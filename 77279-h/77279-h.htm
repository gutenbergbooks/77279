<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">THE</span> subject of dietetics has only of late years begun
to come into its own. For centuries it was
thought that the body was a thing to be neglected and
despised; that it was a clog to the soul. The teachings
of dogma and the life of the hermit and the ascetic
glorified the mortification of the body and the elevation
of the soul.</p>

<p>The study of the functions of life and the manner
in which those functions are upheld and vivified—the
development of the sciences of Biology and Physiology—have
placed the relations of the body and its
inhabitant the soul on a more consistent and rational
basis. It is coming to be recognized that the mind
cannot function to its highest efficiency in a body
below par; that in order to work harmoniously
and to accomplish the most for humanity, the sound
mind must dwell in a sound body, with all of its
functions active, its organs in vigorous condition,
kept so by a thorough assimilation and a forceful
circulation. These are to be secured by means of
daily exercise, abundance of fresh air, and healthful,
happy, constructive thoughts.</p>

<p>It has been well said that the distinguishing feature
between man and other animals is the fact that he
is a cooking animal. Until he discovered fire man’s
subsistence was little more than that of the brute.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
Out of his discovery of the varied uses of this element
came modern civilization. Much of this advance
was made possible through the added strength of
mind that was given man by a more varied diet.
His limited raw diet gave little scope to his inventive
faculties. From the discovery of the possibilities in
cooked food his mind was stimulated to research in
other directions. With the lessened need for vigorous
mastication, however, the degeneration of man’s
teeth began and we are slowly learning now that
exercise for the teeth and gums is as necessary for
their health as it is for the rest of the body.</p>

<p>Dietetics is, in itself, both an Art and a Science.
Food can be prepared so tastefully and its appearance
made so pleasing as to become a fit subject for a
painter. But the selection of food that shall give the
body all the elements it needs in its work of growth
and repair, with the greatest economy of effort, of
purse, of time, and of energy, needs the trained judgment,
the knowledge of comparative values and of
chemical combinations possessed by a scientist.
This is especially true from the fact that so many
bodily ills result from a faulty digestion, due either to
the food itself or to the condition of the organs which
must handle the food.</p>

<p>The subject is so vast and its ramifications so many
that all the resources of chemistry own themselves
baffled at some of its intricacies. However, an intelligent
working knowledge of the processes undergone
by food in its progress through the body, and its
transformation into vital force, can be attained by
anyone.</p>

<p>This book is the outcome of years of experience in
correcting bodily ills caused by wrong hygienic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
habits. It has been written out of a sincere desire to
awaken the every-day individual to the important
relation that food bears to his well-being.</p>

<p>Much has been written on this subject by medical
men for the medical profession, in language too
technical for the layman. It is believed that in this
book the layman will find a fund of information
hitherto not available to him, in language stripped of
technicalities, plain and easily understood. I have
tried to make it logical and interesting.</p>

<p>When the American people become convinced that
a thing is needed they generally “go after” it, and
sooner or later the desired thing is attained. When
they arouse themselves to see that the food they eat
is pure, well prepared, and taken into digestive
systems vigorous by means of proper exercise and
fresh air, a new and far more virile race will be the
outcome.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">THE</span> problem of proper nutrition for the body is as
vital as any study affecting the morals, health,
and consequent power of a nation, since on the quality
and quantity of food they assimilate, depend the
sustenance, health, and strength of its citizens.</p>

<p>The food eaten by a nation largely determines the
character of that nation.</p>

<p>No subject is so vital to the individual, to the family,
the community, the nation, as health. No education
is so vital as a knowledge of foods, sanitation, hygiene.</p>

<p>Health is the basis of happiness and the attainment
of happiness is man’s chief pursuit. The very foundation
of national life is the education of its citizens
in its preservation. The nation seeks prosperity
and happiness—yet true prosperity is based on these
fundamentals.</p>

<p>Money can be expended for no object which will
yield the nation, or the individual, greater returns than
in the acquisition of a knowledge of how to keep well.
Health specialists, in the future, will direct their work
more to the prevention than to the cure of diseases.</p>

<p>The strongest powers are those which most fully
guard the health of their citizens. The endurance of
an army lies in the strength of the individual soldier.</p>

<p>The basic work for “preparedness” is in building
the bulwarks of physical strength and endurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>

<p>The study of life is of most vital interest. The
enjoyment and maintenance of life is inbred. It is
intuitive. The infant’s first instinct is the preservation
of life; almost immediately he seeks for
nourishment.</p>

<p>His body is an ever awakening wonder to him. He
begins his education by testing his lungs, by studying
his hands, his legs, and his flesh.</p>

<p>The human race spends more time in providing
nourishment for the body than in any other line of
activity. Yet we are wasteful; we have not studied
to make the food yield its greatest nourishment and
the body its greatest efficiency.</p>

<p>Unless the system is thoroughly nourished we miss
much of the physical satisfaction of life; we miss the
joys of mental development, the inspiration of soul,
the sense of growth, of freedom, of expansion, and the
self-satisfaction of accomplishing. The satisfaction
resulting from greatest usefulness and the enjoyment
of the results of usefulness, the greatest blessings and
the largest measure of life come only to those whose
nutriment is proper in quantity and quality, taken
properly as to time, and is thoroughly assimilated,
because both body and brain are thereby enabled to
develop most fully.</p>

<p>The enjoyment of vibrant life, of bodily efficiency,
is far beyond the fancied joys of the intemperate or
the ascetic.</p>

<p>That one may thoroughly enjoy life in the freedom
which comes from perfect activity of bodily functions,
it is necessary that proper <em>habits</em> be formed, then the
energy of thought is not constantly engaged in deciding
what is best. Habit calls for no conscious expenditure
of energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span></p>

<p>Nutrition is a broad subject. It means not only
that the foods be supplied which contain elements
required to rebuild body substance and to create heat
and energy, but it embraces, also, the ability of the
body to appropriate the foods to its needs.</p>

<p>The study of nutrition in its full sense, therefore,
must embrace not only foods, but anatomy and physiology
(particularly of the digestive system). A
knowledge of chemistry is also necessary that we may
know the changes foods undergo in being converted
into tissue, heat, and energy.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This science is known
as Dietetics.</p>

<p>Scientific research along the lines of electricity,
psychology, metaphysics, medicine, and art has been
tenaciously pursued for centuries; yet scientific study
of the natural means of keeping the body in health,
that the individual may be in physical, mental, and
moral condition to enjoy and to profit by researches
made in other lines, has been neglected.</p>

<p>The entire framework of the body—bone, muscle,
blood, brain, and nerve—as well as the heat and the
mental and physical energy necessary for every motion
is supplied from food and drink, and from the
oxygen breathed into the lungs.</p>

<p>We are learning that derangements of the body are
largely caused by injudicious eating, yet, vital as it is,
the subject of foods, except in recent years, has not had
a place in the courses of study in our public schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span></p>

<p>We have given much attention to the “pound of
cure,” but insufficient attention to the “ounce of
prevention.” Man does not enjoy life to its full,
nor do his physical or mental efforts yield him his
best returns unless his system is thoroughly nourished.</p>

<p>Formerly, the physician gave general directions,
or none at all, as to the diet. His directions, when
given, were often indefinite because the subject was
not definitely understood, due to the fact that the
course of instruction in medical colleges contained
practically nothing on the subject of foods. This
study is not in the curriculum of all of our medical
colleges to-day.</p>

<p>Our public-school curriculum contains no more
important study than that of health and of the simple,
hygienic laws which enable us to retain it. The science
of foods in their relation to health, sanitation,
and general hygiene should be among the foremost
requirements of our public-school courses of study.
Mothers’ clubs will find no more interesting or profitable
study than Dietetics.</p>

<p>It is coming to be widely recognized that a far
larger number of diseases arise from the food habit
than from the liquor habit. Many who look with
contempt or pity on the victims of alcohol, are themselves
diseased of body through the unintelligent use
of food.</p>

<p>Habitual overeating not only produces diseases of
the digestive organs, from overwork and excessive
secretory activity, but also of the excretory and glandular
system, as the kidneys and the liver, and may
give rise to functional disturbances of the heart.</p>

<p>Food, if taken in greater quantity than the digestive
juices can handle, either passes out of the system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
without being absorbed or it ferments or decomposes,
giving rise to constipation, diarrhea, or other intestinal
disturbances.</p>

<p>If the stomach and intestines are active and can
handle the excess of food, its absorption beyond what
the system requires overloads the blood and causes
obesity or diseases of the skin and kidneys. It thus
brings about abnormal deposits as in gout, or the calculi
found in the kidney or the gall-bladder. Biliousness
and congestion of the liver may follow, with
constant headache, coated tongue, foul breath, and
languor of body and of mind.</p>

<p>Many habitually eat too much and take too little
fluid, though, due to a greater spread of knowledge,
overeating is becoming less common.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an insufficient or illy balanced
diet will bring in its train disorders of the system
scarcely less harmful. A large number, particularly of
young girls, take insufficient food, eat irregularly, and
are undernourished.</p>

<p>When one does not eat sufficient food or the proper
kind and variety, the tissues of the digestive organs
are undernourished and do their work imperfectly.</p>

<p>The undernourished are usually those who work
at high tension, those who worry, or those who do
not get bodily exercise proportionate to the mental.</p>

<p>Mental workers are liable to become preoccupied
and forget to take food. Growing girls who are over-interested
in studies, anxious concerning examinations,
etc., neglect their meals. Parents are often to blame
in these cases by unduly encouraging the intellectual
effort.</p>

<p>Members of some religious sects practice undereating
as a form of asceticism; many others from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
poverty are unable to procure a sufficient amount of
food.</p>

<p>Too many, if not the majority of those concerned
with the purchase and preparation of food, understand
but little of food values and the importance of
their proper combination. No matter how simple
the menu, it should embrace the elements the system
needs for its complete sustenance.</p>

<p>The problem of nutrition must be solved largely
through chemistry. The health and efficiency of the
individual and of the nation depend on careful study
of the foods placed on the market, their chemical
components, and their possible adulteration.</p>

<p>Happily the United States Government, realizing
that its power as a nation depends on the strength
and health of its citizens, has established experimental
and analytical food departments. As a result of the
findings of the government chemists, there was enacted
in 1906, the Food and Drugs Act, which has
raised the standard of food purity, by prescribing
the conditions under which foods may be manufactured
and sold. The law compels the maker of artificially
colored or preserved food products to correctly
label his goods. The national law instigated the
passage of various state laws, which have further
helped to insure a supply of pure food products;
yet we need other laws which shall have greater
efficiency and wider scope.</p>

<p>The strength of Germany as a nation is due very
largely to the government supervision of foods manufactured
and imported.</p>

<p>There is no more important branch of the United
States Government than that which protects the
health of its citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span></p>

<p>The custom among some nations of retaining a
physician to <em>maintain</em> the health of the family rather
than to <em>regain</em> it, to <em>avoid</em> disease rather than to <em>cure</em> it,
has its distinct advantages.</p>

<p>We should not be satisfied with anything less than
perfect health and we are beginning to realize that
this perfect health is a possibility for almost every
individual.</p>

<p>In the maintenance of health, as well as in the cure
of disease, diet is often more important than drugs.</p>

<p>To-day, scientific knowledge of hygiene and of food
values is within the reach of all, and every mother
and teacher may learn how to guard the health of
those in her charge.</p>

<p>It is necessary to know the comparative values of
foods as nutrient agents, in order to maintain our
bodies in health and strength, and with economy of
digestive effort, as well as efficiency.</p>

<p>There is no study, therefore, more important than
that of bodily nutrition, which comprises not only the
right proportion of food and drink, but also the manner
in which they must be prepared in order to yield
the best returns under varying conditions—age,
employment, health, and sickness.</p>

<p>The body is certainly a marvelous machine! It is
self-building, self-repairing, and, to a degree, self-regulating.</p>

<p>It appropriates to its use foodstuffs for growth and
for repair.</p>

<p>It eliminates its waste.</p>

<p>It supplies the energy for rebuilding, and eliminating
this waste.</p>

<p>It directs its own emotions.</p>

<p>It supplies the energy for these emotions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span></p>

<p>It discriminates in the selection of food and casts
out refuse and foodstuffs not needed.</p>

<p>It forms brain cells and creates mental force with
which to control the organism.</p>

<p>It keeps in repair the nerves, which are the telegraph
wires connecting the brain with all parts of the
body.</p>

<p>It converts the potential energy in the food into
heat with which to keep itself warm.</p>

<p>Withal it is not left entirely free to do its work
automatically. It has within it a higher intelligence,
a spiritual force, which may definitely
hamper its workings by getting a wrong control of
the telegraph wires, thus interfering with the digestion,
the heart action, the lungs, and all metabolic
changes. The right exercise of this higher
intelligence, in turn, depends on the condition of
the body, because when the mechanism of the body
is out of repair it hampers mental and spiritual
control.</p>

<p>About one-third of the food eaten goes to maintain
the life of the body in its incessant work of repairing
and rebuilding, the remaining two-thirds being held
in reserve for other activities.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable and the least understood
of any of the assimilative and absorptive functions,
is the ability shown by one part of the body to
appropriate from the foods the elements necessary
for its own rebuilding, while the same elements pass
through other organs untouched. The body has the
power, also, not only to make use of the foods, but to
use up the blood tissue itself. Just how this is done
is also a mystery.</p>

<p>There is surely a great lesson in industry here, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
one of the most profound studies in economics, physics,
and chemistry.</p>

<p>Habitual worriers use up force and become thin
more quickly than those whose work is muscular.
Those who spend their lives fretting over existing
conditions, or worrying over things which never happen,
use up much brain force and create disagreeable
conditions within, resulting in digestive ills. These
again react on the body and continue the process of
impoverishment of the tissues.</p>

<p>Certain it is that improper foods affect the disposition,
retard the spiritual growth, and change the
current of one’s life and of the lives about one. Therefore
the intelligent care of the body—the medium
through which the soul communicates with material
surroundings—is a Christian duty.</p>

<p>“The priest with liver trouble and the parishioner
with indigestion, do not evidence that skilled Christian
living so essential to the higher life.”</p>

<p>Man has become so engrossed and hedged about
with the complex demands of social, civic, and, domestic
life, all of which call for undue energy and annoyance
and lead him into careless or extravagant habits
of eating and living, that he forgets to apply the intelligence
which he puts into his business to the care of
the machine which does the work. Yet the simple
laws of nature in the care of the body are plainer and
easier to follow than the complex habits which he
forms.</p>

<p>The “simple life” embraces the habits of eating
as well as the habits of doing and of thinking.</p>

<p><em>The whole problem of perfect health and efficient activity
is in keeping the supply of assimilated food equal
to the demand, in keeping a forceful circulation that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
nourishment may freely reach all tissues and the waste
be eliminated, and in full breathing habits that sufficient
oxygen be supplied to put the waste in condition for
elimination.</em></p>

<span class="fs80">PURPOSES OF FOOD</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> purposes of food are:</p>

<p>To supply the material out of which the body
may rebuild the tissues.</p>

<p>To produce heat, and to liberate muscular and
mental energy.</p>

<p>Every particle of body substance is constantly
changing. The new material for cells and tissues, the
substance to supply the energy needed in the metabolic
work of tearing down and rebuilding, the energy
used in the digestive process of converting the food
into condition to be assimilated, and the energy used
in muscular, brain, and nerve movement must all be
supplied by food.</p>

<p>Every effort of the brain in the process of thinking,
every motion, and every muscular movement requires
energy which the food must supply.</p>

<p>The body is composed of a vast number of cells
varying according to the tissue or organ in which they
are found. The characteristic of all living matter is
that it constantly reproduces itself. Cells perform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
their appointed work, wear out, and must be replaced
by new ones or derangements follow.</p>

<p>The new cells constantly being formed, increase
in size and in so doing push the worn-out, dying, and
dead cells out of the way. The process of building
and eliminating continues within the body and on its
surface every instant of life.</p>

<p>An idea of the number of dead cells constantly being
thrown off from every part of the body may be gained
by noticing the amount of dead skin cast off. The fine
scales of “scarf” or “dead” skin, which we easily rub
off in a friction bath, are composed of these dead cells
which have been crowded out by the hosts of vital
cells constantly forming beneath. The process is the
same in every tissue and organ. The dead or worn-out
matter within the body is burned by oxygen and
put in condition to be carried by the blood to the organs
of elimination, the kidneys, intestines, lungs,
and skin.</p>

<p>Much waste is eliminated in liquid form through
the sweat glands. It is said that stokers throw off
four pounds of water and waste a day through the
skin.</p>

<p>In the growing child the process of building and of
eliminating is active and rapid. In the youth it is
less rapid, in the adult still less, but unless the process
is kept active, stagnation and death ensue.</p>

<p><em>Daily exercise is necessary to keep up the body activities;
yet very few take the trouble to secure daily a complete,
thorough circulation of blood, especially through
the vital organs and the deeper tissues. Perfect circulation
is the key-note of health.</em></p>

<p>Activity of any kind necessitates the expenditure
of energy. The process is a chemical one and in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
chemical processes heat is necessary to cause the
decomposition of elements and their recomposition
into different substances.</p>

<p>Heat in its turn has two functions. It enables the
chemical changes to be carried on which fit the food
for the use of the various tissues, and it burns to an
ash the worn-out products of the body’s activity,
fitting them for elimination.</p>

<p>It keeps the tissues flexible and the secretions fluid;
coagulation takes place when the secretions become
cold.</p>

<p>As previously stated, food in the body, then, is
needed for two purposes:</p>

<p>(1) to build and maintain the cell until its work is
done;</p>

<p>(2) to furnish the heat necessary to decompose
the food into its elements, and to produce the energy
by which all the body processes are carried on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Food
Elements</div>

<p>That the food may be appropriated by
the body it must be not only proper in kind
and quantity, but the body must also be
in condition to digest, absorb, and assimilate it and
to eliminate the waste, otherwise the body needs are
not met.</p>

<p>It is the nourishment which <em>the body assimilates and
appropriates to its needs</em> which counts in food economy,
<em>not necessarily the amount consumed</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore if the food is to economically serve its
purpose, the body must be in a condition to digest and
assimilate it—<em>this condition depends largely on perfect
circulation, correct position of organs, and correct
breathing habits</em>.</p>

<p>Of the fifteen to twenty substances contained in
foods and comprised in the body, the principal ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
are oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, chlorin, sodium,
potassium, magnesium, iron, calcium, phosphorus,
and sulphur. The differences in the forms of matter
lie in the proportions in which these elements are
combined.</p>

<p>Those containing the largest proportion of nitrogen
are called <em>Nitrogenous</em> foods or <em>Protein</em>—such as meat,
eggs, and some vegetables.</p>

<p>Those containing the largest proportion of carbon
are known as <em>Carbonaceous</em>—such as cereals, sugar, and
fat.</p>

<p>The four food elements, indispensable to life, either
of plant or animal, are oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and
nitrogen.</p>

<p>Carbon combined with oxygen forms carbon dioxid.</p>

<p>Oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxid largely form
the air.</p>

<p>Oxygen and hydrogen form water.</p>

<p>Calcium, iron, magnesium, sodium, and potassium
are used in the formation of the various tissues and
secretions of the body.</p>

<p>The substances contained in living organisms are
the same as those in inorganic matter, only in different
complexities as appropriated to the needs of each
organism.</p>

<p>The difference between living and non-living matter
is in the relative proportion and arrangement of the
same elements.</p>

<p>Before it is fit to supply the needs of the body, the
raw material must undergo a chemical change.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated by scientific investigation
that no unorganized elements, such as pure nitrogen,
pure iron or magnesium, are assimilated by the
system and converted into its various structures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>While the body needs carbon, it cannot use coal;
it needs nitrogen, yet it cannot appropriate it to rebuilding
bone and muscle, until, by chemical action
with other elements, it has been converted into complex
substances called proteins.</p>

<p>The muscles, ligaments, and labor-performing
structures contain the largest amount of nitrogen.</p>

<p>The fat contains the largest amount of carbon.</p>

<p>The brain, the nerves, and the bones contain the
largest proportion of phosphorus compounds.</p>

<p>Yet, while the brain contains phosphorus, and the
tissues nitrogen, the brain cannot be built up by eating
elementary phosphorus, nor the muscles by pure nitrogen,
but compounds rich in phosphorus or nitrogen
may be utilized.</p>

<p>Plants use the simple compounds of the earth, air,
and soil, and, within their own cells, build them up
into such complex substances as starch, sugar, protein,
fat, and salts, putting them in condition for man and
other animals to appropriate to their use.</p>

<p>All plant life is compounded from the elements in
the soil, air, and water, by the action of the sun’s
rays. The rays of heat and light store something of
their power in latent heat and energy in these plant
compounds.</p>

<p>The end of plant life is the completion of its
compounds—when it has matured them, the plant
dies.</p>

<p>All organic matter is thus formed by the action of
the sun’s rays on inorganic matter.</p>

<p>The gluten of wheat is formed from the chemical
union of nitrogen in the air and nitrogen in the soil
with other substances.</p>

<p>The starch of wheat and other grains is from carbon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
which the plant has taken from the soil and combined
with other substances.</p>

<p>All meats are largely derived from plants which
have appropriated the elements from the soil, water,
and air. The chemical processes of the animal convert
the energy latent in the plant foods into the more
concentrated form of meat. The animal thus performs
a part of the chemical work for man—the digestive
organs of one animal convert the food contained
in certain plants, into a substance more easily assimilated
by another animal.</p>

<p>Man would need to eat a large amount of nitrogen-containing
plants in order to get as much protein
as is contained in one egg or in a piece of lean meat
the size of an egg. It is because the nitrogen is in
such condensed form in meat and eggs that one is
likely to take more than the system can handle, if
he eats too freely of these two foods, particularly of
meat. We will discuss this question more fully under
“Proteins.”</p>

<p>Most domestic animals take their food elements
from air and water, as well as from the compounds
which the plants have formed, while wild animals and
some domestic ones, such as hogs and chickens, make
use of meat as well.</p>

<p>The greater part of muscle, nerve, and gland is
composed of <em>protein</em>.</p>

<p>When the muscles are exercised constantly they
use up their protein and must have it resupplied, or
the muscle substance will waste. When the muscles
are exercised freely, as in the laborer, or the athlete,
they need more building material.</p>

<p>The skeleton is composed largely of deposited <em>salts</em>,
as <em>calcium</em>. If, therefore, the growing child be not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
supplied with a sufficient amount of this substance,
the bones will be weak and liable to deformity and
the teeth will be slow in coming or will be small and
malformed. Children need foods rich in lime.</p>

<p>The elements which supply heat and keep up muscular
activity are <em>starches, fats, and sugars</em>.</p>

<p>It must be apparent to every thoughtful person,
that, since the nerves, muscles, and glands are composed
largely of protein and the skeleton largely of
calcium salts, in order to furnish the body with the
elements necessary for growth and repair, all of these
elements, as also the energy-producing substances,
must be provided.</p>

<p><em>Each individual, therefore, should learn how much he
requires to replace his daily waste, both for rebuilding
tissue and for supplying heat and energy.</em></p>

<p>The day laborer, though he may do more muscular
work than an athlete in training, expends scarcely
any nervous energy. Therefore he needs less protein
in his diet than one does who expends both nervous
and muscular activity, as does the athlete.</p>

<span class="fs80">CLASSIFICATION OF FOOD ELEMENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">By</span> foodstuffs are meant the chemical elements
appropriated by the animal for the use of the
body, as previously described.</p>

<p>By foods are meant those articles of diet found in
the market which contain the chemical elements used
by the body in various combinations. Bread, for
example, contains all of the foodstuffs and has been
called the staff of life, because it sustains life. This
refers to bread made from the whole of the grain.
White bread, as commonly eaten, is not the “staff
of life.”</p>

<p>Foods may contain elements, not foodstuffs, and
not used by the body, but cast out as waste. Certain
foods, such as sugar, corn-starch, olive oil,
and egg albumin, contain only one foodstuff, as
will be noted in the following classification, in which
the foodstuffs are grouped according to the body
uses.</p>

<p>The classification of foods is based on the principal
organic foodstuffs they contain. The preponderance
of the elements in any one food determines its chief
use in the body.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the chief uses of foods
are to produce heat and energy, to build the tissue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the growing child, and to repair the tissues in the
child and the adult.</p>

<p>Nearly all foods are made up of a combination of
substances.</p>

<p>The following tabulations give the classification
of foods based on their predominating elements.</p>

<p class="bold">Nitrogenous foods:</p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">
<span style="padding-left: 3em">Lean meat</span><br>

<span style="padding-left: 3em">Nuts</span><br>
<span style="padding-left: 3em">Milk</span><br>
</p>

<p>Vegetables are mixtures of sugars and starches;</p>

<p>Fruits are mixtures of sugars, vegetable acids, and
salts;</p>

<p>Milk, legumes, cereals, and nuts contain a more
equal division of sugars, fats, and proteins, and are
therefore represented as carbo-nitrogenous;</p>

<p>Lean meats, with the exception of shellfish, contain
no starch, but all meats contain protein, fat, and
water.</p>

<p>In the above tabulation, examples are given of foodstuffs
which are almost pure representatives of their
classes.</p>

<p>Corn-starch, sago, and tapioca are practically pure
starch, containing very little of any other element;</p>

<p>Glucose, cane sugar, syrups, and honey are almost
pure sugar;</p>

<p>Butter, lard, and olive oil are nearly all pure fat;</p>

<p>Egg albumin, gluten of flour, and lean meat are
almost pure protein.</p>

<p>As previously stated, however, no food contains
but one element of foodstuffs.</p>


<h3><em>NITROGENOUS FOODSTUFFS OR PROTEINS</em></h3>

<p><em>Protein</em> is a complex combination consisting of
seventeen elements. The digestive organs split up
protein into these seventeen substances, and they
enter the blood thus split. When they reach the
tissues, each tissue selects the elements it needs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
recombines them according to its own peculiar functional
uses.</p>

<p>Meat and eggs contain the complete protein.</p>

<p>Protein exists in all vegetables, but few vegetables
contain protein which is made up of the whole seventeen
substances, hence more vegetable food has to be
eaten to secure the protein in the quantity and combination
necessary to maintain life.</p>

<p>Of these seventeen elements the predominating
ones are nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphates. The
predominance of nitrogen has given the proteins the
name nitrogenous.</p>

<p>Proteins are the tissue builders.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be well to state that blood
is a tissue; thus meat and eggs build the blood, as well
as muscle and sinew.</p>

<p>All nitrogenous foods contain considerable carbon—mostly
in the form of fat in the meat elements—but
the carbonaceous foods contain so little protein
that the protein elements do not appreciably enter
into the nutrition.</p>

<p>Carbon and nitrogen in the carbo-nitrogenous
foods are about equal in proportion.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous or protein elements in the body
constitute about one-fifth of its weight. They form
the basis of blood, lymph, muscle, sinew, bone, skin,
cartilage, and other tissues.</p>

<p>Worn-out body tissue is constantly being torn down
and eliminated and the protein in the foods must
daily furnish material for repair, as well as for building
new tissue.</p>

<p>A young animal’s first need is for growth, as it has
not learned to exercise sufficiently to use much latent
energy. The first food it receives is an animal product—milk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
to babes and other mammals—while the
young chicken or bird is nourished by the yolk of the
egg contained within it. Sufficient yolk substance
remains within the chick when it is hatched to sustain
its life for the first day or two.</p>

<p>Nitrogenous foods are more concentrated and contain
less waste; thus a smaller bulk is required than of
vegetables and fruits. According to recent experiments,
the average adult requires from two to four
ounces of nitrogenous foods a day, to repair the waste.
Happily, when more is consumed, the system has the
power up to a certain limit (depending on the physical
condition and the daily activity), to eliminate an
excess.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that if the daily waste is not
replaced, digestion and nutrition suffer. The system
must have the two to four ounces necessary to supply
the nitrogen daily excreted, or the tissues themselves
will be consumed.</p>

<p>The proteins, of which meat is the principal member,
are classified as:</p>

<p>Albuminoids: albumin (white of eggs), casein (curd
of milk), myosin (the basis of lean meat and gluten
of wheat);</p>

<p>Gelatinoids: (connective tissue of meat);</p>

<p>Extractives: (appetizing and flavoring elements).</p>

<p>If protein material is taken into the body in excess
of its needs the excess is used as fuel. While vastly
more expensive, an excess of protein is worth no more
as fuel than starch is; 1 gram of protein produces 4.1
calories of heat, no more than 1 gram of starch.</p>

<p>The proteins produce heat and energy when the
supply of sugars, starches, and fats is exhausted, but
proteins alone form muscle and the larger part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
blood and sinew. They are, in this sense, the most
important of foods; they are also the most costly.</p>

<p>An excess of protein, usually eaten in the daily
intake of food, then, is of no practical use and can
be eliminated with great benefit to the pocketbook.
Meat once a day is sufficient. The excessive consumption
of meat can be lessened with no lack of
nutrition to the body. The trouble is that meat is
the first thing thought of for a meal; it is easily prepared
and housewives are not willing to use the thought
and effort necessary to secure a balanced meal without
it.</p>


<h3><em>CARBONACEOUS FOODSTUFFS</em></h3>

<p>The carbonaceous foods are those used by the body
for heat and energy and are so named because they
contain a large proportion of carbon—the heat-producing
element.</p>

<p>It is the carbon in wood, which, uniting with oxygen,
produces heat and light.</p>

<p>The carbonaceous foods are all composed of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, the difference between them
being in the different proportions in which these
elements are combined.</p>

<p>They are divided into two classes, Carbohydrates
and Fats.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Carbohydrates</div>

<p>The carbohydrates embrace the <em>sugars</em>
and <em>starches</em> and include such substance as
the starches of vegetables and grains (notably
corn, rice, wheat, and the root vegetables), and
the sugar of milk, of fruits, vegetables, and the sap
of trees. Their chief office is to create energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The starches are converted into sugar, so they are
together given the one name of carbohydrate. The
name means that carbon and hydrogen are contained
in them in such a proportion that when oxygen unites
with the hydrogen, water is produced and the carbon
is liberated. In this chemical process heat is produced.
One gram of carbohydrate produces 4.1
calories of heat.</p>

<p>They are almost entirely absent from meat and
eggs, the animal having converted them into fats.</p>

<p>When the digestive organs are in a normal condition
carbohydrates are easily digested.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They do
not play a large part in the growth of the body tissues,
but they are utilized by the body to spare the consumption
of the fat which is stored in the tissues as a reserve.
This explains their action in preserving but
not producing fat. When there is an excess of fat
and the desire is to reduce, the carbohydrates should
be limited that the body may call on the reserve fat
for heat and energy.</p>

<p>Few realize that after the starches and fats have
been consumed in heat and energy the tissues are
consumed.</p>

<p>The assimilation of the carbohydrates is almost
complete, so that the energy derived from them may
be closely calculated.</p>


<h3><em>SUGAR</em></h3>

<p>There are many varieties of sugar. Those commonly
used as foods are, cane sugar (sucrose), fruit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
sugar (levulose), sugar of milk (lactose), sugar of malt
(maltose), sugar of grapes or corn (glucose), maple
sugar, honey, and saccharin—a coal-tar product. They
are derived from plants, from trees, and from tubers
or other vegetables.</p>

<p><em>Cane sugar</em> (sucrose) is derived from the juice of
the sugar cane and from beets. One-third of the
world’s supply of sugar is derived from the sugar cane
and two-thirds from beets. From two to ten per
cent. of sucrose may be obtained from the maple tree.
It is also found in the sugar pea.</p>

<p>All sugars are carbohydrates—carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen—the oxygen and hydrogen being in the
proportions which form water (two atoms of hydrogen
and one of oxygen).</p>

<p><em>Brown sugar</em> is granulated sugar in an early stage
of refinement.</p>

<p><em>Maple sugar</em> is obtained by boiling down the sap
of the maple tree. It is often adulterated with other
sugars or with glucose from corn, because they are
cheaper. This adulteration does not make it unwholesome,
but causes it to lose its distinct maple
taste.</p>

<p>The nutritive value of sugar is said to be about
ninety-five per cent.</p>

<p><em>Glucose</em> was formerly derived almost entirely from
grapes. Later the process was discovered by which
the starch in corn was converted into glucose. It is
produced so much more cheaply from corn that this
is now the chief source of supply.</p>

<p>Glucose is also found in most of the fruits, in combination
with other sugars. It needs little change to
be absorbed by the system and quickly overloads the
digestive apparatus if much of it is eaten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>It is pure, wholesome, and cheap, and for this reason
it is often combined with other sugars. It is not so
sweet as cane sugar, though just as nutritious. Many
of the syrups on the market are made from it.</p>

<p>Candy is often made from glucose instead of from
molasses or cane sugar.</p>

<p>Much candy, unless one is actively exercising, tends
to produce indigestion.</p>

<p>While glucose is wholesome, it ferments readily.</p>

<p>Before sugar can be used by the system, it is changed
into the easily absorbed form of the sugar in grapes,
by a ferment in the small intestine. Hence digested
sugar in the body is called grape sugar.</p>

<p><em>Milk sugar</em> needs less chemical change than other
sugars and is taken almost at once into the circulation.
It is contained in the natural food for the infant.</p>

<p>The digested sugar (grape sugar) is further changed
in the body into glycogen. When an excess of sugar
or starch is consumed, it is stored within the body as
glycogen, until required.</p>

<p>Sugar is perhaps a better food than starch, because
less force is required for its digestion and it is easily
assimilated, being more readily converted into dextrose
than are starches.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Moreover it furnishes the
heat and energy needed by those having small power
to digest starch.</p>

<p>Sugar is soon oxidized, and, for this reason may
be eaten by those who need to use an extra amount
of muscular strength, or to get strength quickly. It
yields heat and energy within thirty minutes after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
eating, and in times of great exertion or exhausting
labor, the rapidity with which it is assimilated gives
it advantage over starch. Because it is so quickly
converted into energy it is valuable for children at
active play.</p>

<p>Experiments with soldiers on forced marches, and
in Arctic explorations, have shown the value of sugar
as a food, in enabling the men to withstand hunger,
thirst, and fatigue. Taken in excess, however, particularly
by those of sedentary habits, it clogs the
system as does any other excess of material, creating
difficulties for the liver and kidneys.</p>

<p>During muscular activity, four times as much sugar
is consumed in the body as is ordinarily used in the
body processes.</p>

<p>Used in limited quantities, therefore, according to
the muscular or brain power exercised, sugar is one
of the best foods for the production of energy.</p>

<p>When much sugar is eaten the starches and fats
in the food should be lessened to avoid overloading
the system.</p>

<p>When eaten in excess, sugar may temporarily appear
in the urine unaltered.</p>

<p>It might be inferred that, as all starch must be
converted to sugar before it can be used by the body,
starches might be discarded and replaced by sugars.
A small quantity of sugar, however, soon surfeits
the appetite, and if the foods were confined to those
having a surplus of sugars, sufficient food would not
be eaten to supply other needs of the body. This
lack of appetite occasioned by an excess of sugar is
due, partly, to the fact that the gastric juice is not
secreted so freely when there is much sugar in the
stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Because of the slower secretion of gastric juice and
the surfeit of the appetite occasioned by them, sweetened
foods should not be used at the beginning of a
meal, and, while a moderate amount of sugar is desirable,
a surfeit will cause indigestion. This is particularly
liable when one eats sufficient starch and
sugar at a meal and then eats candy between meals.</p>

<p>Sugar is so readily oxidized and supplies heat and
energy so promptly, that the fats stored in the tissues
are not called on until the latent energy in the sugar
is used. The power of sugar to fatten thus lies in
sparing the use of body fat; when starch and fat are
used in addition to sugar an excess of fat quickly
results. Therefore, those who wish to reduce in
flesh should eat sparingly of sugar that the starches
and fats may be used to furnish energy, but sugar
should be as freely used as the system can handle it,
by those who wish to build up in flesh.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, about one-fourth of a pound of
sugar, daily, in connection with other foods, is well
utilized by the system, the quantity depending on
whether one leads an active or a sedentary life.</p>

<p>The natural flavor of fruits and grains is very largely
destroyed by sugar, which is used too freely on many
articles of diet. Sugar should never be added to
fruits while cooking, if intended for immediate use,
as the acids of the fruits neutralize a portion of the
sugar. More sugar is thus used than is needed after
the cooking process is completed.</p>

<p>The sweet taste in all fruits and vegetables is due
to the presence of sugar. Sweet potatoes, beets,
carrots, parsnips, turnips, grapes, figs, and dates are
especially rich in sugar, and when these are furnished
with a meal, in any appreciable quantity, the starches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
should be restricted—notably bread, Irish potatoes,
and rice.</p>

<p>Those who do hard work in the open air, because
of the increased oxidation, can consume larger quantities
of sugar in pie or other pastry, which ordinarily
would be difficult to digest. One who lives an indoor
life should refrain from an undue indulgence in such
foods.</p>

<p>For one who is undernourished, sugar is a desirable
food, if the starch be diminished in proportion as the
amount of sugar is increased; but the tendency in
sweetening foods is to take more starch also than the
system requires, since it is the carbohydrate foods
which are ordinarily sweetened—not the proteins.</p>

<p>On account of their latent heat and energy, sugars
are more desirable in cold weather than in warm.
For this reason Nature supplies them more abundantly
in the root vegetables, eaten more freely in cold
weather. More puddings and heavier desserts may
be eaten in cold weather.</p>

<p>The desire of the child for sweets is a natural one,
because the child uses much energy, and sugar supplies
this energy with less tax of the digestive system.
When the child begins to eat more solid foods, if sugar
is used in abundance for sweetening, he is no longer
attracted by the mild sweetness of fresh milk, and it is
well not to sweeten cereals or other foods, also to
limit other sweets, when the child turns against milk,
in order to restore the taste for this valuable food.
Many authorities state that a child, up to its third
year, should not be allowed to taste artificial sweets,
in order that the appetite may not be perverted from
the natural sweets of milk.</p>

<p>Sugar is better supplied the child in a lump or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
home-made molasses candy, rather than in the sweetening
of porridge, oatmeal, or bread and milk, etc.</p>

<p>Molasses is readily absorbed and is mildly laxative,
and when young children are not allowed to eat too
much, it assists in keeping the bowels open.</p>

<p>Sweet fruits, fully ripened, contain much sugar
and should be freely given to the child.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Starch</div>

<p>Starch is one of the most important
carbohydrates. It is formed from the
carbon dioxid and water in the air and in the soil by
the chemical action of the sun’s rays on the cells of
living plants.</p>

<p>As stated, corn-starch, sago, tapioca, and arrowroot
are practically pure starch. Rice is almost pure
starch.</p>

<p>Corn-starch is obtained from young maturing corn;
tapioca comes from a tropical plant, cassava; sago
from the pith of the sago palm; arrowroot from a
plant of the same name, a native of the West Indies.</p>

<p>Starch lacks flavor and for this reason all starchy
foods are seasoned with salt. Salt increases the
activity of the saliva and pancreatic juices.</p>

<p>All starches must undergo much chemical change
by action of the saliva and the intestinal juices, before
they can be used by the body.</p>

<p>The digestion is begun by the saliva in the mouth
and is continued in the stomach, by the saliva, until
the gastric secretions begin to act.</p>

<p>Starch is not acted on by the gastric juice but passes
unchanged into the intestines, where it is converted,
by the pancreatic juice, into dextrin, maltose, and
glucose. It is thus absorbed into the blood.</p>

<p>After the digested starch passes into the blood it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
taken to the liver and is there changed into glycogen
and is stored in reserve. When the system needs to
produce energy it is first furnished by the glycogen.
When this is exhausted the fats and proteins are used.</p>

<p>The <em>starches</em> and <em>sugars</em> then are really the energy
“reserves” of the body, any excess over the daily
needs being stored until required.</p>

<p>Starchy foods should not be given to any one in
whom, from disease or derangement, the starch-converting
ferments, ptyalin in the saliva and pancreatin
in the pancreatic juice, are lacking.</p>

<p>Because the child has not developed the ferment in
sufficient quantities necessary for starch digestion,
starchy food must not be given to a child under twelve
to eighteen months; at least not until he has teeth
and chews his food. Then he should be given starchy
food in the form of a crust or hard cracker which he
chews thoroughly and mixes with saliva.</p>

<p>Potatoes or bananas which the child does not masticate,
should not be given him under the age of two
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fat</div>

<p>Fat is the most concentrated form of fuel
and is readily oxidized. It has about
twice the fuel value of carbohydrates. It is almost
pure carbon, hence less chemical work is required to
convert it into fuel, but more oxygen is needed.</p>

<p>The average fat person does not breathe deeply
and does not take in sufficient oxygen to cause a combustion
of the fat and produce energy. He is thus
inclined to be lethargic.</p>

<p>A pound of fat has about three times as much fuel
value as a pound of wheat flour, which consists largely
of starch.</p>

<p>Common examples of fat are butter, cream, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
fat of meat and of nuts, and the oil of grains and
seeds—notably the cocoanut, olive, and oatmeal.</p>

<p>Fat forms about twenty per cent. of the weight of
the normal body.</p>

<p>The body cannot remain in health for long unless a
proper amount of fatty food is eaten. Muscular and
nerve action, and the formation of the digestive secretions
are all dependent on the energy derived from
the combustion of fat. Its use in this way spares the
tissues from destruction in the chemical processes
necessary to life.</p>

<p>Both carbohydrates and fats are composed of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, the difference being that
there is less oxygen in fat. One pound of starch requires
one and one fifth pounds of oxygen for perfect
combustion, while one pound of suet requires three
pounds of oxygen. One ounce of fat yields two
and one-half times as much energy as an ounce of
sugar or starch.</p>

<p>Fats are not digested in the stomach. The connective
tissue about the fat is dissolved here, and the
fat is passed on into the small intestine, where it is
acted on by the bile and the intestinal juices. These
first change the fat into an emulsion and then into
the form of soap and glycerin. In this saponified
form, it is in condition to be absorbed and carried to
the tissues, where it is assimilated and used in energy.
The commercial production of soap from oil is similar
to the chemical change in the body of fat into soap.</p>

<p>The supply of fat stored in the body depends on the
quantity consumed with the food, on the quantity
used up in heat and energy in muscular or mental
exercise. The quantity assimilated depends somewhat
on the condition of the nerves. If the nerves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
are weak, they do not strongly direct digestion and
assimilation and less fat is used in the digestive and
assimilative processes; thus, in case of weak nerves
more fat is often stored in the tissues. An excess of
fat often indicates sluggish nerve activity.</p>

<p>Manual laborers require more fat for energy than
do people whose habits are sedentary. School-children,
or children who play hard, should have
sufficient fat and sugar.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><em>Butter and Cream.</em> The fat present in milk, depends
of course, on the quality of the milk. There is as
much butter-fat in a glass of fresh Jersey milk as in
a glass of cream from the milk of some cows. The
cream from some Jersey cows is eighty per cent.
butter-fat.</p>

<p>Skimmed milk contains very little fat. If milk is
drunk by the adult, as a means of storing up more fat
within the body, the cream, if assimilated, should be
stirred into it.</p>

<p><em>The Fat of Meat.</em> This should be thoroughly cooked.
All meats in the process of baking or frying should be
covered, in order to retain the moisture. The fat in
well-roasted beef is nutritious, but <em>to make fat easily
digestible it should be well masticated so as to break
up the tissue fibers which surround it</em>.</p>

<p>While fried foods are difficult of digestion (see page
<a href="#Page_192">192</a>) because the surface albumin is coagulated and the
hot fat forms a coating around it, making it difficult for
the digestive juices to reach the tissue, the fat of
bacon is more easily dissolved because of the delicacy
of the fibers surrounding the fat cells. If thinly
sliced and fully immersed in its own grease in the
process of frying, bacon is an easily digested fat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
The process of smoking the bacon renders it easier of
digestion.</p>

<p>Cooked bone-marrow is an easily digested form of
fat which is usually relished by those to whom any
other fat is repulsive. It is useful in some forms of
anemia, as it contains considerable iron.</p>

<p>Eels, salmon, and mackerel contain much fat.</p>

<p>The Eskimos extensively use both whale and seal
oil as a food.</p>

<p>The yolks of eggs are also rich in fat.</p>

<p><em>Cod-Liver Oil</em>, pressed from the liver of the codfish,
is easily absorbed and assimilated by some. The
odor is not pleasant and a little lemon juice, salt,
baking soda, or any flavoring substance may be added
to make it palatable. The pure oil taken in this way
is, perhaps, preferable to the prepared emulsions.</p>

<p><em>Olive Oil</em> is derived from ripe olives. It is often
used when cod-liver oil is not well borne. Many
take olive oil for the purpose of rounding out the
figure with fat. If the system will assimilate fat,
taken in quantities, the fat may be stored; but, as a
rule, one is underweight because of a failure to assimilate
the regular diet and overloading the digestive
organs with fat will not cause a better assimilation.
If the lack of flesh is due to sluggish assimilation
exercise should always accompany a diet for the
building of flesh.</p>

<p>Olive oil, in moderation, is a good food when much
heat and energy are required, but if one’s occupation
is sedentary, much fat is not necessary.</p>

<p><em>Cotton-seed Oil</em> is often substituted or mixed with
the cheaper grades of olive oil. It is wholesome, if
fresh, but has not the pleasing flavor of the olive.</p>

<p><em>Nut Oils</em> are good, but, with the exception of peanut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
butter, are not often used. English walnuts, hickory
nuts, pecans, cocoanuts, and Brazil nuts contain much
oil. Nut oils are not well borne by some, hence nuts
must be sparingly used by them. If taken they
should be used with salt, and be thoroughly masticated.</p>

<p>Almond oil and olive oil are used in cooking, to
some extent.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To summarize—digested sugar is called dextrose
or glucose; digested starch becomes first dextrin, then
maltose (animal sugar); digested protein is peptone;
and digested fat is saponified fat.</p>


<h3><em>WATER</em></h3>

<p>No food element is more important for the needs
of the body than water. It is composed of oxygen
and hydrogen. It forms the large part of the blood
and lymph.</p>

<p>The body will subsist for weeks on the food stored
in its tissues; it will even consume the tissues themselves,
but it would soon burn itself up without water,
and the thirst after a few days without it almost drives
one insane.</p>

<p>Though it produces force only indirectly, it is entitled
to be classed as a food, because it composes
about two-thirds of the weight of the body and a large
part of all the tissues and secretions. Yeo estimates
that the supply of water to the body should be averaged
at half an ounce for each pound of body weight.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that from four to five pints
of water are excreted each day by the body and therefore
a similar amount should be consumed daily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
The average individual at normal exercise, requires
about seventy one and one half ounces of water daily,
which equals about nine glasses (one glass of water
weighs one-half pound). Some of this may be
obtained from the food.</p>

<p>By reference to Tables I to V it will be noted that
water forms a large percentage of all food, particularly
of green vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p>In order that the body may do efficient work in
digestion and in the distribution of the nutrient elements
of the foods, and that the evaporation from the
body may be maintained, the water in the foods,
together with the beverages drunk, should consist of
about seventy-five per cent. liquid to twenty-five
per cent. nutrient elements, or about three times as
much in weight as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates
combined.</p>

<p>Much of the water taken passes through the system
without chemical change and is constantly being
thrown off by the skin, lungs, kidneys, and intestines.</p>

<p>Some of the water is split up into hydrogen and
oxygen to unite with other substances in the chemical
changes carried on during the process of digestion, and
some water is obtained from the food by the union of
hydrogen and oxygen liberated by the action of the
digestive juices.</p>

<p>Few people give much thought to its resupply;
yet, ignorant of the cause, they suffer from its loss,
in imperfect digestion and assimilation, and in kidney
and intestinal difficulties. If it is withheld from the
diet for a while, marked changes occur in the structure
and processes of the body. The effect is seen
in the lessening of the secretions, the increasing dryness
of all the tissues, including the nerves, and if the lack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
is long continued, in progressive emaciation, weakness,
and death.</p>

<p>Water is the heat regulator of the body, and the
more energy used, either in work or in play which
results in more heat and evaporation, the more water
is required. An animal, if warm, immediately seeks
water.</p>

<p>It is constantly being used in the body to form solutions
in which the waste products are held so that the
eliminative organs may dispose of them.</p>

<p>It is the chief agent in increasing the peristaltic
action of both the stomach and intestines, thus aiding
in mixing the food with the digestive juices and assisting
the movement along the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>It increases the flow of saliva and of the digestive
juices and aids these juices in reaching every particle
of food.</p>

<p>It dissolves the foods, and helps in the distribution
of food materials throughout the body, carrying them
in the blood and the lymph from the digestive organs
to the tissues, where they are assimilated.</p>

<p>The blood carries the water to the various secreting
and excreting glands and its increased pressure aids
both the secreting and excreting activity. The digestive
organs secrete their juices more freely, digestion
is aided, more nutriment is rendered absorbable,
more carbon dioxid is liberated, and more oxygen is
taken into the blood which thereby is made richer
and more life-giving.</p>

<p>One engrossed in business or household cares may
forget to take water between meals. In such a case,
the blood, in order to preserve its volume, must
draw the water from the tissues, which, in consequence,
become less moist. The mouth becomes dry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
saliva is scanty, appetite fails, the digestion is not
so active, the digestive and other secretions are
lessened in quantity, the food in process of digestion
becomes more solid, its absorption in the intestine
is more difficult, it moves slowly along the intestinal
canal, and constipation results. The body is not so
well nourished and falls a more ready prey to disease.</p>

<p>The supply of fluid furnished to the kidneys is not
sufficient, the urine becomes more concentrated and
irritation may result. The foundation is thus laid for
derangements of the kidney function.</p>

<p><em>To maintain the equilibrium of the body forces, water
drinking should be established as a permanent habit
and be firmly adhered to as a part of the daily program.</em></p>

<p>Many claim that one’s thirst, as in the desire for
food, is the only safe guide to the amount and time
of drinking, but these desires are largely matters of
habit, and tastes are often perverted. Unless the condition
is abnormal or the mind becomes so intensely
active that one fails to listen to the call of Nature,
<em>the system calls for what it has been in the habit of receiving</em>
and at the stated times it has been in the habit
of receiving it. It does not always call for what is
good for it.</p>

<p>Plants thrive after a shower because the falling
water brings down the impurities in the air which
constitute plant food. Rain-water for household use,
therefore, should never be collected during the early
part of a shower or rain storm.</p>

<p>Spring water, from its filtration through earth rich
in mineral deposits, usually contains a certain percentage
of those minerals, as salt, sulphur, or iron,
dissolved through the action of the carbon dioxid
contained in the water. Some of these springs have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
become famous health resorts. The contained carbon
dioxid gives spring water its pleasant, sparkling taste.
Spring water is remarkably free from organic life.</p>

<p>Water as used in cities usually needs careful filtration
and purification to rid it of its contained sand
and other impurities. The housewife whose water
supply is derived from rivers does this on a small scale
when she strains out the mud and sand from the water
which she is often compelled to use when the river is
in flood and full of impurities.</p>

<p>Drinking water should be perfectly clear and without
odor. Even a small amount of decomposing vegetable
or animal matter can be detected by its odor, if
the water is confined for a short time in a bottle or
closed jar.</p>

<p>The health of the body depends to a large degree
on the purity of the water. Contaminated water is
a menace to health.</p>

<p>Water which appears perfectly clear may be badly
contaminated with typhoid or other germs. For this
reason no water should be used until it has been boiled
if one is not sure of its purity. Water from wells
near barns and cesspools is often impure.</p>

<p>“Hard” water, as derived from wells, is usually
rich in calcium and magnesium. When water contains
a large percentage of these substances, it usually
causes constipation and indigestion and may aid in
the formation of gall-stones or gravel.</p>

<p>The kidneys are especially the great eliminators of
water and aid in maintaining the equilibrium of the
blood. Except in conditions in which they need rest,
water should be freely drunk in order to stimulate
them to activity and to assist them in throwing off
the body waste held in solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>One cannot form a better habit than that of drinking
two or three glasses of water on first arising and
then exercising the stomach and intestines by a series
of movements which alternately contract and relax
the walls of those organs, causing their thorough
cleansing.</p>

<p>This internal bath is as necessary as the cleansing
of the skin. Often, in gastritis or a catarrhal condition
of the stomach, a large amount of mucus will
collect in the stomach over night, and the cleansing
of the mucous lining of the digestive tract is then
most important.</p>

<p>If in good health, two or three glasses of cool water,
vigorous exercises for the vital organs, and deep
breathing of pure air, followed by a cold bath, will do
more to keep the health, vigor, clear skin, and sparkling
eye than fortunes spent on seeking new climates,
mineral waters, or tonics.</p>

<p>When cool water in the morning seems to chill one,
a glass of hot water may be followed by a glass of cool.</p>

<p>The free drinking of water aids the activity of the
skin, keeping the tissues moist and the glands active.</p>

<p>Effervescing waters are usually drunk for their
cooling and refreshing effect. They should not be
drunk to excess as they are usually combined with
syrups or sugar and will thus occasion derangement
of digestion, flatulence, and in some cases palpitation
from the excess of gas which presses on the diaphragm
and impedes the action of the heart.</p>

<p>Mineral waters are drunk for the action of the
salts which they contain and are used for their laxative
or their medicinal effect. Kissengen, Hunyadi Janos,
Epsom, Carlsbad, and our own Saratoga are examples
of laxative waters. These all contain sodium and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
magnesium sulphates and are known as “bitter”
waters.</p>

<p>Table waters, as Apollinaris, Vichy, or others containing
carbon dioxid are refreshing and wholesome
and may be used in nausea and vomiting for their
quieting effect. Those who are unable to take milk
will often find its digestion will be aided if the milk
be mixed with Vichy or seltzer water.</p>

<p>When water is used as a hot drink it should be
freshly drawn, brought to a boil, and used at once.
This sterilizes it and develops a better flavor.</p>

<p>Cold water should be thoroughly cooled, but not
iced. Water is best cooled by placing the receptacle
on ice rather than by putting ice in the water. Impure
or contaminated ice will contaminate water.</p>

<p>The theory has long been held that water drinking
at meals is injurious, the objection being that the food
is not so thoroughly masticated if washed down with
water, and that it dilutes the digestive juices. But
this theory is now rejected by the best authorities.</p>

<p><em>When water drinking at meals is allowed to interfere
with mastication and is used to wash down the food, the
objection is well taken</em>, but one need rarely drink while
food is in the mouth; the water should be taken at
rest periods between mouthfuls.</p>

<p><em>Thorough mastication and a consequent free mixing
of the food with saliva is one of the most essential steps in
digestion</em>, and the flow of gastric juice, as the flow of
saliva, is stimulated by the water.</p>

<p>It is singular that the use of water at meals has
long been considered unwise when the free use of milk,
which is about seven-eighths water, has been recommended.</p>

<p>The copious drinking of cool water from a half hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to an hour before a meal will cleanse the stomach and
incite the flow of saliva and gastric juice, thus aiding
digestion.</p>

<p>Moreover, the digestive cells secrete their juices more
freely and the sucking villi absorb more readily when
the stomach and intestines are moderately full, either
of food or water, and to fill the stomach with food
requires too much digestive and eliminative activity.</p>

<p>Water taken before meals passes through the stomach
before the food, washes away any mucus that may
have collected over the mouths of the gastric glands,
stimulates them to activity, and prepares the stomach
to receive the food.</p>

<p>Results obtained, in building up about twenty
thousand thin women, show that the free drinking of
liquid at meals has a tendency to increase flesh. Probably
one reason for this is the cleanliness and greater
freedom it gives to the absorbing and secreting cells
of the mucous lining of the digestive tract, the stronger
peristalsis it occasions, and the consequent better
digestion.</p>

<p>When one wishes to reduce in flesh, water drinking
at meals is restricted.</p>

<p>If the contents of the stomach have become too
concentrated or solid, the water will render it more
liquid, hence will aid the admixture with the gastric
juices and will enable it more readily to pass the pyloric
orifice.</p>

<p>Drinking at meals, therefore, has many more arguments
in its favor than against it.</p>

<p>All who have a tendency to the deposit of uric acid
in the tissues, as in gout, should drink freely of water
to lessen the deposit of salts from the blood which
must maintain its proportion of fluid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>More water should be drunk if the meal consists
largely of protein. The nitrogen it contains is eliminated
in a short time by the kidneys, the amount
of urine is increased, and more water must be drunk
to make up the loss.</p>

<p>In sickness, as in fever, the increased respiration
causes a corresponding loss of water from the skin
and the lungs. If the bowels are active as in diarrhea,
much water is lost in this way. The increase in the
heat of the body also tends to dry all the secretions,
hence water must be taken to keep them in proper
fluidity.</p>

<p>The patient is often too ill to ask for water or will
forget to ask for it. Constipation may result from
this cause. It must be a part of the nurse’s duty to
see that a sufficient amount is taken. An excess of
cold water, if hastily taken, may cause cramps. If
slowly sipped it will do no harm.</p>

<p>Water may be given in fever in the form of lemonade;
a small pinch of soda will make it effervescent
and more refreshing.</p>

<p><em>There is no tonic like water, exercise, and fresh air.</em>
The safe method is not to allow the habit of drinking
water with regularity to be broken, unless for some
necessary purpose, and then the habit should be
reinstated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Soft water, that is, water containing no lime or
other mineral, is best. Hard water which causes
any degree of curdling of soap, or a lime crust in the
bottom of a teakettle, renders digestion difficult.</p>

<p>Bacteria are killed and much of the mineral matter
is deposited by boiling the water. Boiled water
tastes flat or insipid. It may regain its original,
fresh taste by filling a jar half full of water, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
shaking the jar so that the air passes through the
water.</p>


<h3><em>SALTS</em></h3>

<p>The salts of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium
and some other substances, are necessary for
proper bodily functioning. Taken with the food,
they pass into the tissues without change and can be
recovered, unchanged, from the tissues and the urine.</p>

<p>The uses of some of these substances are not thoroughly
understood, but if deprived of them, the nutrition
of the body suffers.</p>

<p>Lime (calcium) is necessary for the bones and teeth
and to preserve the coagulability of the blood.</p>

<p>Sodium chlorid (common salt) aids the formation of
hydrochloric acid and the activity of the pancreatic
juice.</p>

<p>The salts of iron are necessary for the blood.</p>

<p>Other salts are also needed to carry on the chemical
reactions in the digestive system.</p>

<p>Cereals, all vegetables, fruits, and nuts furnish both
calcium salts and sodium, potassium, and magnesium,
which are the salts in the blood and lymph. Minerals
are also abundant in dried legumes (beans and peas).</p>

<p>Fruits and nuts contain the least amount of these
salts, and meats, vegetables, and cereals follow in the
order named, cereals, that is the whole of the grain—not
the white flour—containing the most. Any diet,
therefore, which recommends the use of fruits and nuts
to the exclusion of other foods, depletes the system of
some of the body-building elements. The system
may seem to thrive for a time on such food because,
perhaps, of the rest given to overworked organs, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
eventually the body lack will manifest itself; anemia
may appear or malnutrition become evident.</p>

<p>Milk furnishes salts in proper proportion for building
the bones and teeth of the baby; because of the
lime which it contains it is a good food for the growing
child. After the child is one year old, eggs may be
added to the diet. During the first year the albumin
and fats in the egg are not well digested. It is especially
essential that children be furnished milk and
eggs that they may be assured of the proper proportion
and quantity of calcium salts for growth.</p>

<p>Sodium chlorid (common salt) has been for ages
recognized as an important element in food, so important
that in Eastern countries it is the symbol of
hospitality and friendship.</p>

<p>When taken in moderate quantities, salt increases
the activity of the gastric secretion and aids the
appetite. When taken in excess, as many who have
formed the salt-eating habit do, it is an irritant to
the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines
and may interfere with nutrition, causing dyspepsia,
gastroenteritis or diarrhea from the continued
irritation.</p>

<p>The habit indulged by some of nibbling at salted
nuts of various kinds, at and between meals, may for
a short time satisfy the needs of the body for more
salt than is usually taken with the food, but such a
habit persisted in will cause acidity of the stomach
from overstimulation of the hydrochloric acid producing
glands; it will also decrease the fluidity of the
blood by causing the water to be drawn from the blood
for the use of the tissues. Irritative action is also
exerted on the kidney, as any excess of salt is excreted
by this organ. For this reason salt is often prohibited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
for those suffering from any inflammation of the
kidney, in Bright’s disease, etc.</p>

<p>When chemical tests show an excess of hydrochloric
acid, salt should be omitted from the diet.</p>

<p>A diet consisting largely of vegetables needs the
addition of sodium chlorid to supply sufficient salt
for body uses; likewise more salt than is contained in
grass and fodder is needed for animals, particularly
for those producing milk. The scientific farmer
salts his cattle regularly, while wild animals travel
miles and form beaten paths to springs containing
salt.</p>

<p>In rectal feeding, it is known that food absorbs more
readily through the large intestine if salted. It is
probable that salt, in normal proportions, also aids
absorption in the stomach and small intestine.</p>

<p><em>Potassium</em> is next in importance to sodium as it
constitutes the chief salt in the muscles. It also aids
the action of the digestive secretions and the maintenance
of the reaction of the urine. Potatoes and
apples are valuable foods on account of the potassium
they contain.</p>

<p><em>Calcium</em>, if in excess, may cause the formation of
calculi, renal or biliary. It is also found in the tartar
which accumulates on the teeth, in the hardening
walls of the arteries in arteriosclerosis, etc. All of
the cabbage family are rich in calcium. Many
mineral waters and the water from many wells contain
it in excess.</p>

<p>Those addicted to gall-stones, gravel, etc., should
particularly avoid “hard” water.</p>

<p><em>Phosphorus</em> and sulphur are obtained by the body
from eggs and milk and from such vegetables as corn,
cauliflower, asparagus, and turnips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p><em>Iron</em> is necessary in forming the pigment of the red
blood corpuscles.</p>

<p>If, through some disturbance in digestion, absorption
or assimilation, the iron taken in the food is not
utilized, or is insufficient in amount, the blood-making
organs do not receive the necessary amount of this
substance and the red corpuscles are not formed in
sufficient numbers. The blood becomes poor in
hemoglobin, and the individual becomes pale and
loses vitality. This condition is known as anemia.</p>

<p><em>Potatoes.</em> It will be noted from the table given
above that sweet potatoes contain a larger percentage
of carbohydrates, hence they produce more heat and
energy than any other vegetable; next to the sweet
potato comes the Irish or white potato.</p>

<p>While the white potato contains two per cent. of
protein, this is almost all located in a very thin layer
immediately beneath the skin, so that when the potato
is peeled in the ordinary way, the protein is removed.
This is true of many vegetables. They lose their
distinctive flavor, as well as their value as tissue-building
foods, when the skins are removed, especially
before cooking. Many vegetables may be peeled
after being cooked and their value in nutrition is thus
increased. All tubers gain in dietetic value if they
are cooked in their skins, the thin outer covering
being removed after the cooking process is completed.
The ordinary cook, however, is unwilling to take the
trouble to prepare them in this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>In vegetables as usually prepared for the table the
proportion of carbohydrates is increased and the proportion
of protein is diminished. The skins render
many of the foods unsightly, hence they are discarded
in the preparation for cooking.</p>

<p>When a potato is baked the outer skin is readily
separated from the less perceptible layer containing
the protein. Potatoes boiled in their skins retain the
protein.</p>

<p>In the white potato, of the twenty-two per cent.
of carbohydrates, three and two-tenths per cent. is
sugar and eighteen and eight-tenths per cent. is
starch. In the sweet potato ten and two-tenths per
cent. is sugar and sixteen per cent. is starch.</p>

<p>Since sugar digests more quickly than starch, the
sweet potato digests more quickly than the white.
Because of the large percentage of carbohydrates in
each, it is a mistake to eat these two vegetables at
the same meal, unless the quantity of each is lessened.
For the same reason, bread and potatoes, or rice and
potatoes, should not be eaten to any extent at the
same meal, unless by one who is doing heavy manual
labor, requiring much energy.</p>

<p><em>Onions.</em> Only about four per cent. of the onion
represents nourishment; the eleven and three-tenths
per cent. of carbohydrates is made up of two and
eight-tenths per cent. sugar and the rest of extractives.
Of the extractives the volatile oil, which
causes the eyes to water when onions are peeled, is
the most important.</p>

<p>The onion is not, therefore, so important for its
actual nourishing qualities as for its relish and flavor,
and for this it is to be commended.</p>

<p>It is a diuretic, encouraging a free action of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
kidneys. Because of its diuretic value it is commonly
called a healthful food. An onion and lettuce sandwich
stimulates the action of the kidneys and is a
nerve sedative.</p>

<p>The volatile oil makes the raw onion difficult for
some to digest and, in that case, should be omitted
from the diet.</p>

<p><em>Beets.</em> There is no starch in beets, their seven
and three-tenths per cent. of carbohydrates being
sugar. They possess, therefore, more nutritive value
than onions, and they are easily digested. It will
be noted that it takes many beets to make a pound
of sugar.</p>

<p>There are no more delicate or nutritious greens than
the stem and leaf of the beet. These greens contain
much iron and are valuable aids in building up the
iron in the blood, thus aiding in the correction of
anemia.</p>

<p><em>Carrots.</em> Carrots are valuable as food chiefly on
account of their sugar. They are somewhat more
difficult of digestion than beets and they contain
more waste. They make a good side dish, boiled
and served with butter or cream.</p>

<p><em>Turnips.</em> Turnips have little value as a food.
Their nutriment is in the sugar they contain. For
those who enjoy the flavor they are a relish, serving
as an appetizer, and, like the onion, are to be recommended
as a side dish for this purpose.</p>

<p><em>Parsnips.</em> Like carrots, parsnips are chiefly valuable
for their sugar and for the extractives which act
as appetizers.</p>

<p>Since turnips, carrots, onions, and parsnips owe a
part of their nutritive value to the extractives which
whet the appetite for other foods, it follows that, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
one does not enjoy their flavor or their odor, these
vegetables lose in value to that individual as a food.
If one does enjoy the flavor, it adds to their food value,
therefore <em>taste for the flavors of all foods should be
cultivated</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Green
Vegetables</div>

<p>The question may be asked with reason:
“Why do we eat green vegetables?”
They contain only about four per cent.
nutriment, as will be seen in Table <a href="#Page_43">II</a>, and are
mostly made up of water and pulp. It will be
noted that they are distinctly lacking in protein
and in carbohydrates; hence, they have little
food value.</p>

<p>Some of them, however, contain acids which tend
to increase the alkalinity of the blood, and salts which
are needed by the system.</p>

<p>Their merit lies in the fact that they have distinct
flavors and thus whet the appetite. Another reason
why green vegetables are thoroughly enjoyed is because
they come in the spring, when the appetite is
a little surfeited with the winter foods.</p>

<p>They are diuretic, helping the kidneys and the skin
to rid the system of waste.</p>

<p>Because of their bulk of waste they are useful in
constipation as they act as a stimulus to the peristaltic
action of the bowels; thus they are more laxative to
the intestines than the root vegetables, partly because
of the salts which they contain and partly because of
the undigested vegetable fiber. This vegetable fiber,
being coarse, assists in cleansing the mucous lining
of the stomach and intestines. They are diuretic and,
if for no other reason than for this cleansing of the
kidneys, and to make the stomach and intestines more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
efficient, the use of green vegetables is to be commended,
and it is well to eat freely of them.</p>

<p>In larger cities, fresh vegetables are in the markets
the year around, but if they are raised in greenhouses,
or in any way forced, they lack the flavor which comes
with natural maturity and they also lack the full
amount of iron given by the rays of the sun. If raised
in the south and shipped from a distance, they are not
fresh and they do not have as good an effect on
the system as when fresh and fully matured by the
sun.</p>

<p><em>Greens</em>, as spinach, chard, dandelions, and beet tops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
as previously stated, contain iron and build red blood
corpuscles.</p>

<p><em>Cabbage</em>, of which there are many varieties, contains
much sulphur. If fermentation exists in the intestines
the sulphur unites with hydrogen causing gas of an
unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>They promote the formation of calcium oxalate in
the urine and should be avoided as a food by any one
inclined to gout, rheumatism, or gall-stones.</p>

<p>Cabbage is usually not well digested by invalids.</p>

<p>Eaten raw, because of its bulk, it is laxative. Some
dyspeptics, who cannot digest cooked cabbage, digest
raw cabbage readily.</p>

<p><em>Celery</em> is wholesome when cooked, because of the
milk and butter in which it is prepared. Eaten raw
the fiber is hard for the digestive juices to dissolve
and should be thoroughly masticated. It has little
nutritive value save for its appetizing flavor.</p>

<p>Because of the salts, largely sulphates and phosphates,
which it contains, celery has been called a
nerve food, but the proportion of these is so small that
their food value is negligible.</p>

<p><em>Tomatoes</em> are easily digested and are refreshing.
They are not well borne by some and on account of
the oxalic acid they contain should not be used by
those having an excess of uric acid.</p>

<p><em>Asparagus</em>, because of its delicate flavor and appearance
early in spring, is a vegetable universally liked.
It is easily digested and may be eaten by invalids;
they usually greatly relish it. Its particular food
value lies in its sulphur and in its value as an appetizer.</p>

<p><em>Rhubarb</em> is one of the most wholesome of vegetables
and is being much more widely used. Thoroughly
cooked it is digestible and a natural laxative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Its tart flavor and appearance in early spring render
it a pleasant change from the ordinary diet. Eaten
in excess, like cabbage, it produces calcium oxalate
in the urine and should not be eaten in large amounts
by those inclined to gout.</p>

<p>All fresh vegetables should be masticated to almost
a fluid consistency; otherwise, they are difficult of
digestion, containing, as they do, so much fiber.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Fruits</div>

<p>Technically speaking, fruits include all
plant products which bear or contain a
seed. They are valuable for their acids and organic
salts—citrates, malates, or tartrates of potassium,
sodium, magnesium, and calcium.</p>

<p>They are composed for the most part of starch,
sugar, water, and various organic acids, cellulose, and
pectin. (Pectin is the substance which jellies under
heat.) Fruits which do not contain pectin must be
combined with others which do, or with gelatin, if
jelly from them is desired.</p>

<p>The organic acids in fruits are readily split up in
the body, and form alkalis. For this reason acid
fruits are useful in certain acid conditions of the
stomach, because they combine with the stomach
acids, liberating substances which cause an alkaline
reaction.</p>

<p>The citrus fruits—oranges, lemons, grapefruit and
limes—are rich in citric acid.</p>

<p>Malic acid is found in gooseberries, peaches, pears,
apples, currants, and apricots.</p>

<p>Tartaric acid is prominent in grapes.</p>

<p>The value of fruits as a food depends largely on the
amount of starch and sugar they contain, though
their agreeable odor and taste, by furnishing variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
in the diet, render them, also, of great value as
appetizers.</p>

<p>As a rule they contain too much water to be of
great food value if eaten alone.</p>

<p>The organic acids and salts contained in fruits are
of value as they stimulate the activity of the kidneys
and lessen the acidity of the urine. The urine may
even be rendered alkaline by them; hence, when a
test shows evidence of too much uric acid, acid fruits
are used to neutralize the acids in the tissues, particularly
the acids of the citrus fruits.</p>

<p>The fruit juices are readily absorbed and the potassium
calcium, sodium, and magnesium they contain are
liberated with the formation of alkaline carbonates.</p>

<p>These alkalis are largely eliminated through the kidneys,
which accounts for the diuretic effect of fruits,
their acids and salts stimulating the activity of the
kidneys.</p>

<p>The seeds in the small fruits are not digested, but
they serve the purpose of increasing intestinal peristalsis
and of assisting the movement of the contents
of the intestines. The skin and the fiber of fruits also
assist the intestines in this way, just as the fiber in
vegetables does.</p>

<p>All acid fruits—particularly lemons, limes, grapefruit,
and oranges—stimulate the action of the skin
as well as the kidneys and whenever the kidneys and
skin are not sufficiently active, these fruits should be
eaten freely.</p>

<p>In case of an excess of hydrochloric acid in the
stomach, lemon juice or citrus fruits are valuable
about half an hour <em>before</em> a meal, as when taken on an
empty stomach they decrease the secretion of hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>When the secretion of hydrochloric acid is limited,
acids are given <em>after</em> a meal to supplement the
deficiency, or stimulate the glands to activity.</p>

<p><em>Sweet</em> or <em>bland</em> fruits are those containing a lesser
percentage of acids. Among these are pears, raspberries,
grapes, bananas, blackberries, blueberries,
melons, and some peaches, apples, and plums.</p>

<p>Of this class of fruits, dates, figs, prunes, and grapes
(raisins), furnish most nutriment, because, as will be
noted by Table <a href="#Page_47">III</a>, these fruits contain a large
amount of carbohydrates in the form of sugar.</p>

<p>The protein in these sweet fruits is largely in the
seeds and, as the seeds are not digested, they have no
real food value for the individual.</p>

<p>Figs and prunes, peaches, apples, and berries are
laxative—probably the laxative action of figs and
berries is due to the seeds, and of the others to the salts
and acids they contain, and to the cellulose or fibrous
material which furnishes bulk.</p>

<p>The astringent and acid taste of unripe fruits is
due to the tannin and the acids. Oxygen is necessary
to ripen fruits and the slow natural maturing
of the fruit on the tree enables the oxygen to enter
into combination with these substances, lessening
their reaction and altering the starch into glucose or
levulose.</p>

<p>Fruits ripened artificially lack this chemical action
of sun and oxygen, hence the decreased palatability
and digestibility of fruits so ripened. If underripe
fruits are freely eaten they ferment in the alimentary
tract and this fermentation causes the colic, vomiting,
and diarrhea so often experienced. Overripe fruit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
from the decomposition products which have already
begun to form and which are further released in
the stomach or bowels, may produce the same
results.</p>

<p>Care should therefore be exercised to select thoroughly
ripe fruits which have not begun to decay.</p>

<p>In order to reach their destination in fair condition,
outwardly, many fruits are picked before they are
ripe. Bananas are commonly picked green, because
they decay so quickly that if they were picked
ripe they would spoil before reaching the northern
markets.</p>

<p>One test of a naturally ripened apple is to cut it
with a steel knife—if the blade turns black, or if the
cut surface of the apple turns brown in a few minutes,
it should not be eaten, for it indicates an excess of
tannin. It is this tannin which gives the small boy
excruciating pains from his green apples.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the tannin from the bark of
trees toughens the skin of animals and forms leather.
The effect on the membrane of the stomach and
intestines, from the tannin in food, is not so pronounced,
because of the activity and resistance of
living matter.</p>

<p>The juice of lemons and oranges is most valuable
in seasickness and scurvy, and is of benefit in nausea.
A slice of lemon will often clear a coated tongue and
give a refreshing sense of cleanliness to the mouth,
especially in feverish conditions. Sour lemonade is
one of the best drinks in summer because of its thirst-allaying
qualities.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#Page_47">III</a> shows that <em>bananas</em> contain nearly twenty-three
per cent. of carbohydrates, which, in an immature
state, are largely starches. The natural ripening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
process changes the starch to sugar, thus making them
more easily digested. The starch globules, when
not matured on the tree, are not easily broken and are
thus difficult of digestion.</p>

<p>Bananas should not be given to children under two
years of age because before this age the ptyalin and
pancreatin are not sufficiently developed to digest
the starch.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants of the tropics use bananas
almost to the exclusion of other food and appear well
nourished. They obtain them from the tree when
the fruit has thoroughly ripened, the starch having
been transformed by Nature into an easily digested
product.</p>

<p>The reason many find they cannot digest bananas,
as purchased in our markets, is due to the fact that
the fruit is immature and unripe.</p>

<p>The banana meal or flour is usually thoroughly
digestible, is nourishing, and has an agreeable taste.
Invalids can often take banana meal in the form of
gruel; it makes an appreciated addition to a limited
diet. Made into a porridge and eaten with cream it is
valuable in conditions of inflammation of the gastro-intestinal
tract. The addition of a few drops of lemon
juice renders it palatable to those who like an acid
flavor. Children enjoy it as a variation from cereals.
It is relished by typhoid fever patients as a change
from milk.</p>

<p>It must be carefully cooked and well prepared as,
like oatmeal, it can be spoiled by insufficient or poor
cooking. Owing to the limited demand it is not
obtainable in all markets, as it has not yet become
popularized.</p>

<p><em>Grapes</em>, because of their wholesome qualities, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
useful to the system, as they contain sodium, iron,
magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Because of their
appetizing flavor they are universally enjoyed, and
because they are cheap are universally used. The
skins and seeds are indigestible and, if swallowed,
may cause severe irritation or obstruction of the
intestines. Grapes are rich in sugar, and on this
account must not be eaten by diabetics.</p>

<p>Grape juice, when unfermented, is a valuable drink,
in health, or for the convalescent. It is agreeable
in taste and is mildly laxative. Added to other fruit
juices, as lemon or orange, it allays thirst and furnishes
a pleasant flavor, but on account of its high
percentage of sugar does not allay thirst when used
alone.</p>

<p><em>Apples</em>, so universally used, are easily digestible
when ripe, and may be prepared in so many ways that
they constitute a valuable addition to the diet. Their
laxative qualities, when taken on an empty stomach,
as before breakfast, or just before retiring, are well
known. They are thus valuable in constipation, and
in some forms of dyspepsia may, with benefit, be eaten
raw.</p>

<p>Apples should be thoroughly masticated.</p>

<p>The apple peel contains potassium salts and should
be eaten with the fruit.</p>

<p>Most invalids digest apples better if they are cooked,
especially baked. Stewed apples may have the beaten
white of eggs whipped into them and invalids who
revolt against eggs can take them thus prepared.</p>

<p>Because of the sugar necessary in cooking them they
should be avoided by diabetics, and in conditions
in which there is irritation of the gastro-intestinal
tract.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p><em>Quinces</em> are indigestible when raw, but well
baked and eaten with cream are appetizing and
nourishing.</p>

<p><em>Pineapples</em>, if thoroughly ripe, contain a ferment
which will digest protein, rapidly softening and disintegrating
the tissue of meat. Like the pancreatic
ferment it acts in both alkaline and acid mediums.
Pineapple juice, therefore, is exceedingly valuable as
an addition to the diet. The coarse fibers also have
a laxative action. Care must be taken, however, to
use this fruit only when it is well ripened, as when
green, it is indigestible.</p>

<p>The juice of pineapple, because of the action of the
ferment in dissolving tissue, is valuable in many forms
of sore throat, particularly when accompanied by an
ulcerous condition. The effort should be made to hold
it in the mouth, allowing it to trickle down the throat
by degrees.</p>

<p><em>Dried fruits</em> are less palatable than fresh. Many of
them, as prunes and raisins, are nourishing, but others,
as citron, are indigestible, and should be finely chopped
if used as flavoring.</p>

<p>Dried or evaporated fruits, through the action of
heat, either artificial or from the rays of the sun, have
lost the water they contained, and are preserved by
their own sugar.</p>

<p>Dried grapes, or raisins, because of their sugar,
soon satiate the appetite if eaten raw, but if cooked
or added to cereals, puddings, or breads, enhance
the palatability and nourishing qualities of these
foods.</p>

<p>Dates and figs used in the same way, in cereals or
puddings, are equally valuable.</p>

<p>Dried currants are the most indigestible of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
dried fruits, owing to their large amount of skin in
proportion to the nutriment.</p>


<h3><em>NITROGENOUS FOODS</em></h3>

<p>As previously stated, in a mixed diet, meat and eggs
are the chief sources of nitrogenous foods. Next to
these come the legumes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Meat</div>

<p>Meat is composed largely of muscle fiber and
contains connective tissue and fat. It has
been estimated that beef contains one-third
nutritive material, the other two-thirds being
water and bone. Fat meat contains less nitrogenous
material and less water than lean meat.</p>

<p>Lean meat is almost entirely digested in the stomach
by the gastric juice, which changes it into peptone.
It is needless to say that it should be thoroughly
masticated, that the gastric juice may promptly act
on it. If any part passes into the intestine undigested,
the process is continued by the trypsin of the pancreatic
juice.</p>

<p>The peptone is absorbed and carried by the blood
and lymph to all tissues of the body, where it is used
for growth and repair. As stated under “Heat and
Energy,” any excess of protein above that needed
for growth and repair is oxidized if sufficient oxygen
is breathed, yielding energy and heat, and the waste
is eliminated through the kidneys and the bile.</p>

<p>For purposes of comparison, one pound of beef has
been said to equal in nutritive value, two and one-half
pints or five glasses of milk, one-half pound (two-thirds
of an ordinary baker’s loaf) of bread, and three eggs.
However, these values vary.</p>

<p>The amount of fat in meat varies from two to forty
per cent., according to the animal and to its condition
at the time of killing.</p>

<p>The best meats are from young animals which have
been kept fat and have not been subjected to any
work to toughen the muscles.</p>

<p>It is possible to combine the fat and the lean of meat
so as to meet the requirements of the body without
waste. About ninety-seven per cent. of meat
is assimilated by the system, while a large part
of the vegetable matter consumed is excreted as
refuse.</p>

<p>The compounds contained in animal foods are much
like those of the body, therefore they require comparatively
little digestion to prepare them for assimilation—this
work having been done by the animal—while
the vegetable compounds require much change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
by the digestive system before they can be used in
the body.</p>

<p>The proportion of <em>albuminoids</em>, <em>gelatinoids</em>, and
<em>extractives</em> in meat vary with different meats and with
different cuts of the same meat.</p>

<p>The <em>albuminoids</em> of meat include the meat tissue,
or the muscle cells. These constitute by far the
greater part of the meat.</p>

<p>The <em>gelatinoids</em> are derived from the connective
tissue forming the sheath of the muscle and of bundles
of muscles, the skin, tendons, and the casing of bone.
Gelatins are made from these and, if pure and prepared
in a cleanly manner, they are wholesome.</p>

<p>Gelatin is distinguishable in rich meat soups, which
jelly when cool.</p>

<p>The gelatinoids alone have not a large nutritive
value; they serve to spare the albumin from being
used, though they cannot replace albumin in the diet.
They also, to some extent, keep the muscles from being
consumed when starches, sugars, and fats are lacking.</p>

<p>The <em>extractives</em> are found most abundantly in the
flesh of animals and birds noted for their muscular
activity, as in game. Some of them exert a stimulant
action on the nervous system and others are appetizers,
giving to cooked meats, broths, etc., their pleasing
flavor. In case of anemia, in which it is necessary to
build red blood corpuscles, the blood of beef, the
thought of which is usually repellent, may be made
very palatable if it is heated sufficiently to bring out
the flavor of the extractives, and then seasoned.</p>

<p>Unless the beef extracts on the market contain the
blood tissue, in addition to the extractives, they are
not particularly nourishing and are only valuable in
soups, etc., as appetizers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Soups for nourishment should be made by cooking
the bones, connective tissue, and a part of the meat.
Bones and connective tissue alone make an appetizing
soup, but it contains little nutriment.</p>

<p>One reason why meat soups should constitute the
first course at dinner is because the extractives stimulate
the appetite and start the flow of gastric juices.
Bouillons contain no nourishment, but they may be
used as stimulant restoratives to the muscles, or as
a basis for vegetables, rice, or barley to give them
flavor.</p>

<p>Roasted flesh seems to be more completely digested
than boiled meat; raw meat is more easily digested
than cooked; rare meat is more easily digested than
that thoroughly cooked.</p>

<p>Roasted young chicken and veal are tender, easily
masticated, and easily and rapidly digested in the
stomach. This is one reason why the white meats
are considered a good diet for the invalid, though
veal is usually avoided in cases of dyspepsia, as, if
too young, it may cause diarrhea; if too old, it is less
digestible than beef.</p>

<p>Fat meats remain in the stomach a much longer
time than lean meats; thus, gastric digestion of pork,
which usually contains much fat, is especially difficult,
requiring from three and one-half to four hours
(see page <a href="#Page_22">22</a>).</p>

<p>Preserved and canned meats should be eaten with
the utmost caution, care being taken to know that
they are put up by firms which use extreme care in
their preparation. Inferior meat is sometimes used
in the preparation of these foods. If meats are not
fresh and the canning not carefully done, they may
become putrid after being put up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p><em>Fish</em> and <em>sea foods</em> are, many of them, rich in protein,
as noted in Table <a href="#Page_54">IV</a>. They should never be used
unless absolutely fresh.</p>

<p>The idea is prevalent that fish is a brain food. Fish
is easily digested and builds brain as well as other
tissue, but no more readily than beef does, or any
easily digested, absorbed and assimilated food which
contains a goodly proportion of protein.</p>

<p><em>Lobsters</em> are difficult of digestion and contain little
nutrition, so are not valuable as a food, though they
are relished by many on account of their flavor.</p>

<p><em>Oysters</em>, raw, are easier to digest than when cooked.
Oysters should not be eaten during the spawning season
from May to September.</p>

<p><em>Mussels</em> are nutritious when well prepared and are
rapidly gaining in popularity.</p>

<p><em>Clams</em> furnish a valuable and nutritious food when
prepared in chowder form. Clam broth will often
be retained on an irritable stomach when other food
is rejected by it.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to ascertain the method of
their production as typhoid fever has been contracted
from eating shell fish whose feeding beds were near or
in polluted water.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Eggs</div>

<p>Eggs are excellent articles of food for
nutrition and for tissue building. They
have practically the same value in the diet as meat,
and make a very good substitute for meat. Egg
yolk in abundance is often prescribed when it is
necessary to supply a very nutritious and easily assimilated
diet.</p>

<p>Eggs consist chiefly of two nutrients—protein and
fat (ten per cent.). Because they contain so large a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
proportion of protein they are classified as nitrogenous
foods.</p>

<p>The yolk, which is about one-third fat, contains
iron, sulphur, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and
phosphorus. The white contains some fat and phosphorus.
The white and the yolk contain equal
quantities of protein. The white of the egg is almost
pure albumin.</p>

<p>The dark stain made by eggs on silver is due to the
sulphur.</p>

<p>The iron in the yolk is a valuable assistant in building
red blood corpuscles.</p>

<p>Eggs, in common with other proteins, are changed,
mostly in the stomach, into peptone. That not
digested in the stomach, as is the case with other
proteins, is changed in the intestine.</p>

<p>If the egg is old, or if its absorption is delayed in the
intestine, it decomposes, producing gas, and may cause
intestinal disorder. For this reason no stale egg
should ever be served, especially to an invalid.</p>

<p>One reason why eggs disagree with some is because
too much fat is eaten at the same time. Egg yolk
contains fat and if much extra fat is eaten indigestion
and fermentation in the intestine may result. This
is particularly true in those who digest fat with
difficulty.</p>

<p>When eggs seem to disagree or the system does not
assimilate them well on account of the fat in the
yolk, and eggs are desirable to supply the protein in
the diet, the whites, which contain practically no
fat, may be used. They should be well beaten and
if digestion is weak they may be mixed with fruit
juices.</p>

<p>The citric acid in lemons and oranges partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
digests the egg, the gastric juice quickly changing it
to peptone.</p>

<p>One method of preparing eggs, which is especially
valuable for those having delicate stomachs, is in egg
lemonade or orangeade. Thoroughly beat the egg,
add the juice of half a lemon or orange, sugar to taste,
and fill the glass with water.</p>

<p>Grape juice, cream, and cocoa, if assimilated, may
be used in place of lemon or orange, in order to give
variety when it is necessary to use eggs freely.</p>

<p>Eggnog is another means of taking raw eggs.</p>

<p>One method of testing the freshness of eggs is to
drop them into a strong, salt brine made by adding
two ounces of salt to a pint of water. A fresh egg
will at once sink to the bottom. If the egg is three
days old the surface of the shell will be even with the
surface of the water and an egg two weeks old will
float mostly above the surface.</p>

<p>The opinion is prevalent that a hard-boiled egg is
difficult of digestion, but this depends entirely on the
mastication. If it is masticated so that it is a pulp
before being swallowed, a hard-boiled egg is readily
digested.</p>

<p>A soft-boiled egg should not be boiled longer than
three or four minutes, or better, should be put into
warm water, be allowed to come to a boil, then set
off the fire and the egg be allowed to remain in the
water for ten minutes. This method cooks the egg
through more evenly.</p>

<p>Another method of cooking the yolk evenly with
the white is to put the egg in cold water, let the water
come to a boil, and again immerse the egg in cold
water. The immersing in cold water after boiling
makes hard-boiled eggs peel readily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>


<h3><em>CARBO-NITROGENOUS FOODS</em></h3>

<p>Under this class come cereals, legumes, nuts, milk,
and milk products. In these foods the nitrogenous
and carbonaceous elements are more evenly proportioned
than in either the carbonaceous or nitrogenous
groups. The different food elements in this group
are so evenly divided that one could live for a considerable
length of time on any one food. Some
animals build flesh from nuts alone, while the herbivorous
animals live on cereals and plants.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cereals</div>

<p>Under cereals, used by man for food, come wheat,
oats, rye, barley, rice, and corn. As
will be noted by Table <a href="#Page_61">V</a>, cereals contain
a large proportion of starch and are therefore used
largely for heat and energy. Rice contains the largest
proportion and next to rice, wheat flour.</p>

<p>The values as given in the table refer to the whole
of the grain. When the outer coverings are removed,
as in the white flour and the outer covering of rice,
the proportion of carbohydrates is increased and the
protein and ash are almost entirely eliminated.</p>

<p>There is no part of the world, except the Arctic
regions, where cereals are not extensively cultivated.
From the oats and rye of the north, to the rice of the
hot countries, grains of some kind are staple foods.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>An idea of the importance of cereal foods in the diet may be
gathered from the following data, based on the results obtained
in dietary studies with a large number of American families:
Vegetable foods, including flour, bread, and other cereal products,
furnished 55 per cent. of the total food, 39 per cent. of the protein,
8 per cent. of the fat, and 95 per cent. of the carbohydrates of
the diet. The amounts which cereal foods alone supplied were
22 per cent. of the total food, 31 per cent. of the protein, 7 per
cent. of the fat and 55 per cent. of the total carbohydrates—that
is, about three-quarters of the vegetable protein, one-half of
the carbohydrates, and seven-eighths of the vegetable fat were
supplied by the cereals. Oat, rice, and wheat breakfast foods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
together furnished about 2 per cent. of the total food in protein,
1 per cent. of the total fat, and 4 per cent. of the carbohydrates
of the ordinary mixed diet, as shown by the statistics cited.
These percentage values are not high in themselves, but it must
be remembered that they represent large quantities when we
consider the food consumed by a family in a year.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If one’s work calls for extreme muscular exertion,
the cereals may be eaten freely, but if one’s habits
are sedentary, and the cereals are used in excess, there
is danger of clogging the system with too much starch.
Indeed, for one whose occupation is indoors and requires
little muscular activity, a very little cereal
food, such as bread, cake, etc., will suffice; the carbohydrates
will be supplied, in sufficient quantity,
in vegetables.</p>

<p>Mineral matter is supplied in sufficient quantity
in almost all classes of foods.</p>

<p>Cereals and legumes supply nutrients at less price
than any class of foods; therefore a vegetarian diet
involves less expense than the mixed diet. An entirely
vegetarian diet, however, gradually induces
a condition of muscular weakness in many people,
resulting in a loss of strength. A well-proportioned
mixed diet is best to give strength and activity of both
body and mind.</p>

<p>Meat, eggs, and milk, which usually supply the
proteins, are the most expensive foods, and when
these, for any cause, are eliminated, a large proportion
of proteins should be supplied by the legumes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Wheat</div>

<p>Perhaps no food is as commonly used as
wheat in its various forms. It is composed
of:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>1. The nitrogenous or protein compound, chiefly
represented in the cerealin and the gluten of the bran.
This is removed from white flour and from much of
the so-called “whole wheat” flour.</p>

<p>2. The starch—the center or white part of the
kernel.</p>

<p>3. The fats, occurring chiefly in the germ of the
grain.</p>

<p>4. The phosphorus compounds, iron, and lime,
found in the bran.</p>

<p>The kernel of wheat consists of the bran or covering,
which surrounds the white, pulpy mass of starch
within. In the lower end of the kernel is the germ.</p>

<p><em>Flour.</em> In the old-time process of making flour
the wheat was crushed between stones and then sifted,
first, through a sieve, which separated the outer shell
of the bran; then through bolting cloth, which separated
the white pulp from the inner bran coating.
It was not ground as fine as in the present process,
thus the gluten, phosphorus, and iron (all valuable
substances) were, in the old process, nearly all left
out of the white flour. The second bran coating,
left by the second sifting, was not so coarse as the
outer shell but coarser than the inner. Care was not
formerly observed in having the grain clean before
grinding, the bran containing chaff and dirt, so that
it was not used as food but was considered valuable
for stock, and was called “middlings.”</p>

<p>In the modern process of crushing the wheat between
steel rollers, the white flour of to-day contains
more of the protein from the inner coat of the bran
than the white flour of the old process; hence, it is
more nutritious.</p>

<p><em>Bran.</em> Objection is sometimes made to bran because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
the cellulose shell is not digested, but bran
contains much protein and mineral matter and even
though it is crude fiber, as previously stated, this
fiber has a value as a cleanser for the lining of the
stomach and intestines, and for increasing peristalsis,
thus encouraging the flow of digestive juices and the
elimination of waste. In bread or breakfast foods,
it is desirable to retain it for its laxative effect.</p>

<p>Bran has three coats—the tough, glossy outside,
within this a coat containing most of the coloring
matter, and a third coat, containing a special kind of
protein, known as cerealin. The two outer layers
contain phosphorus compounds, lime, and iron. All
three coats contain gluten.</p>

<p><em>Gluten flour</em> is made of the gluten of wheat. It is
a valuable, easily digested food, containing a large
proportion of protein and little starch. Gluten
bread is used by those who wish to reduce in flesh
and in diabetic cases.</p>

<p><em>Whole wheat</em> flour does not contain the whole of the
wheat, as the name implies; it, however, does contain
all the proteins of the endosperm and the gluten and oil
of the germ, together with all of the starch. As a
flour, therefore, it is a more balanced food than the
white flour, because it contains more nitrogenous
elements.</p>

<p><em>Graham flour</em> is made from the entire wheat kernel
with the exception of the outermost scale of the bran.
It contains the starch, gluten phosphorus compounds,
iron, and lime. It is the most desirable of the flours
because, containing the bran, it assists in digestion
and elimination, and the phosphorus, iron, and lime,
are valuable body builders.</p>

<p><em>Nutri meal</em> is much the same as Graham flour, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
chief difference being that the bran is ground finer.
The wheat is ground between hot rollers, the heat
bringing out the nutty flavor of the bran. Bread
made from it is not only nutritious, but delicious in
flavor. It contains all of the nutrition of the wheat.</p>

<p><em>Bread.</em> As must be implied from the foregoing,
the nutri meal, or graham flours are necessary for
bread if it is to be used as a complete food, the “staff
of life.” The white bread is made from flour which is
almost pure starch; the lime, phosphorus compounds,

<p>Perhaps no form of prepared food has been longer
in vogue than bread. It has been known since history
began. When the entire wheat kernel is used
it probably maintains and supports life and strength
better than any single food, but bread is not the “staff
of life” unless the entire kernel is in the flour.</p>

<p>Children should be given Graham bread or Graham
crackers containing the whole of the grain in order
to obtain the balanced food and the nutritive materials
which are not obtained in bread made of white flour.
Lime for the teeth and the growing bones is in the
bran.</p>

<p>The more porous the bread the more easily it
digests. When full of pores, it is more readily mixed
with the digestive juices.</p>

<p>The pores in bread are produced by the effort of
the gas, released by the yeast, to escape. When
mixed with water, the flour forms a tenacious body
which, when warm, expands under the pressure of
the gas from the yeast, until the dough is full of gas-filled
holes. The walls of gluten do not allow the
gas to escape, and thus the dough is made light and
porous. The more gluten the flour holds, the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
water the dough will take up and the greater will be
the yield of bread; hence, the more gluten, the more
valuable the flour. If the bread is not porous, the
fermentation is not complete, and the bread is heavy.</p>

<p>The albumin in the walls of the expanding bubbles
causes substances which contain beaten eggs to be
more porous when baked.</p>

<p><em>Yeast</em> is a plant fungus. In its feeding, the plant
consumes sugar, changing it into alcohol and carbon
dioxid. If the bread contains no sugar the yeast
plant will change the starch in the flour into sugar for
its feeding.</p>

<p>Many housewives, realizing that the bread begins
to “rise” quicker if it contains sugar, put a little into
the sponge. Unless a large quantity of sugar is put
in, the yeast will consume it and the bread will not
have an unduly sweet taste.</p>

<p>As the yeast causes fermentation, alcohol forms
in the dough. This is driven off in the baking. If
the bread is not thoroughly baked, fermentation
continues and the bread turns sour.</p>

<p>Bread is not thoroughly baked until fermentation
ceases. It is claimed that fermentation does not
entirely cease with one baking; this is the basis of
the theory, held by some, that bread should be twice
baked. The average housekeeper bakes an ordinary
loaf one hour.</p>

<p>Time must be given for the products of fermentation
to evaporate, during the cooling of the bread, before
it is eaten.</p>

<p>Hot or insufficiently cooked bread is difficult of
digestion, because it becomes more or less soggy on
entering the mouth and the stomach, and the saliva
and gastric juices cannot so readily mix with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>The best flour for bread is that made from the
spring wheat, grown in cooler climates, because it is
richer in gluten than the winter wheat. The winter
wheat flour is used more for cakes and pastries.</p>

<p>Bread made with milk, is, of course, richer and
more nutritious than that made with water, and
bread made with potato water contains more starch;
both of these retain their moisture longer than bread
made without them.</p>

<p><em>Mold</em>, which sometimes forms on bread, is, like
the yeast, a minute plant. It is floating about everywhere
in the air, ready to settle down wherever it
finds a suitable home. Moisture and heat favor its
growth; hence bread should be thoroughly cooled
before it is put into a jar or bread box. The bread
box should be ventilated and kept in a cool place.</p>

<p><em>Rye bread</em> contains a little more starch and less
protein than wheat bread. It contains more water
and holds its moisture longer.</p>

<p><em>Biscuits.</em> The objection to eating hot bread does
not hold for baking powder or soda biscuits, if well
cooked, because these cool more rapidly and they do
not contain the yeast plant; hence, they do not ferment
as does the bread.</p>

<p><em>Baking powder</em> is made from bicarbonate of soda
(baking soda) and cream of tartar. When these are
brought in contact with moisture, carbon dioxid is
liberated, and in the effort to escape it causes the
dough to expand and become light.</p>

<p>Breads made with pure baking powder are wholesome
and, when light, are digestible. When made
with cheap baking powder, however, in which alum
or ammonia is employed, the stomach may be irritated
by the chemical substances contained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>The reason that the cook attempts to bake her
biscuits, or anything made with baking powder, as
quickly as possible after the baking powder comes in
contact with the moisture, is that the dough may have
the full effect of the expansion of the gas. If the
room in which she mixes her dough is cool, or if her
biscuit dough is left in a cool place, this is not important,
as heat and moisture are both required for full
combustion. Enough baking powder biscuit dough
may be mixed at one time to provide biscuits every
morning for a week, if buried in flour immediately
after mixing so that it is kept cool and from the air.
A portion may be cut off each morning and the remainder
again buried in the flour.</p>

<p><em>Macaroni</em> and <em>spaghetti</em> are made from a special
wheat flour known as Durum. They contain about
seventy-seven per cent. of starch, little fat, and little
protein. They may take the place of bread, rice, or
potato at a meal.</p>

<p><em>Rice</em> is a staple cereal in all tropical and temperate
climates. It requires special machinery to remove
the husk and the dark, outer skin of the kernel.</p>

<p>The polished rice commonly used, is almost pure
starch, and, like white flour, lacks the nutritive qualities
contained in the husk or covering.</p>

<p>It is seldom eaten within three months after harvesting
and it is considered even better after two or
three years. It requires thorough cooking.</p>

<p><em>Wild rice</em> is used by the North American Indians.
The seeds are longer, thinner, and darker, than the
cultivated rice. It is coming into favor as a side dish
but it is served more particularly at hotels in soup
and with game.</p>

<p>As previously stated, rice contains a larger proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
of starch than any other cereal and the smallest
proportion of protein. Next to rice, in starches,
comes wheat flour; yet whole wheat or graham flour
contain half as much again of protein.</p>

<p>Because of the quantity of starch in flour, potatoes,
and rice, it is obvious that one should not eat freely
of more than one of these at the same meal, else the
digestive organs will be overworked in converting the
starch into sugar, the liver overworked in converting
the sugar into glycogen and back again into sugar,
and be overloaded in storing it up.</p>

<p>By far the best plan is to eat but one cereal at a
meal.</p>

<p>Rice contains no gluten, hence it cannot be raised
in bread.</p>

<p>Unhusked rice is called paddy. The “vitamins”
of rice are in the covering.</p>

<p>A German investigator, working to discover the
cause of the disorder of nutrition known as “beriberi”
occurring in those who used polished rice freely,
found that in those who used <em>un</em>polished rice, from
which the outer husk had not been removed, the
disease did not appear. He gave the name of “vitamin”
to the substance in the outer husk, which prevented
the disease.</p>

<p>While these substances were discovered while
working with rice, they have since come to include
other substances which affect the nutritive value of
food. The term “vitamin” has since been given to
other apparently necessary elements in foods which
seem to determine their nutritive value to the system.
These necessary elements, “vitamins,” may be the
spices and flavors used in the food, and sometimes,
perhaps, may be the flavors resulting from the action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of benign bacteria, as those which give the delicious
flavor to butter and cheese.</p>

<p>Food, however nutritious, is lessened in its value to
the system unless it appeals to the senses by its mode
of preparation, seasoning, serving, and freshness.
Sternberg insists that the senses of smell and taste
determine chemical changes in foods with greater
sensitiveness than chemical tests.</p>

<p>Dishes unskillfully prepared are not relished. Some
chemical change has occurred which the senses detect
and these dishes are rendered less wholesome, lacking
the necessary “vitamin.” Distaste, loss of appetite,
and even nausea and vomiting may occur.</p>

<p>Sternberg calls attention anew to the fact that the
science of cooking is a complicated one and is a matter
of taste in the widest sense of the term, that vitamins
may largely be produced in the preparation of the
food.</p>

<p><em>Corn</em> (maize) is a native of America and has been
one of the most extensively used cereals.</p>

<p>The chief products of corn are hominy, corn meal,
cracked corn, samp, glucose, corn-starch and laundry
starch. Alcohol is also made from it.</p>

<p>Corn bread and corn-meal mush were important
foods with the early settlers, partly because they are
nutritious and partly because the corn meal was easily
prepared at the mill and was cheap.</p>

<p>The germ of the corn is larger in proportion than
the germs of other grains, and it contains much fat;
therefore it is heating. For this reason, it is strange
that corn bread is so largely used by inhabitants of
the southern states. It is a more appropriate food
for winter in cold climates.</p>

<p>Because of the fat in the germ, corn meal readily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
turns rancid, and, on this account, the germ is separated
and omitted from many corn-meal preparations.</p>

<p><em>Hulled corn</em>, sometimes called lye hominy, is one
of the old-fashioned ways of using corn. In its preparation,
the skin is loosened by steeping the corn
in a weak solution of lye, which gives it a peculiar
flavor, pleasing to many.</p>

<p><em>Corn-meal mush</em> is a valuable breakfast food if eaten
with milk. If fried it should be covered with flour
or dry corn meal and fried in deep fat, so that it does
not soak up the fat.</p>

<p><em>Popcorn.</em> The bursting of the shell in popping
corn is due to the expansion of the moisture in the
starch, occasioned by the heat.</p>

<p><em>Green sweet corn</em> does not contain the same proportion
of starch as corn meal, it being, in its tender state,
mostly water. It is laxative, because it is eaten with
the coarse hull, which causes more rapid peristalsis
of the intestines. It should be well masticated to
break the covering of the husk; the digestive juices
cannot penetrate the hard covering.</p>

<p>The claims made for various advertised
breakfast foods would be amusing if they
were not intended to mislead. Nearly all
of them have sufficient merit to sell them if the advertiser
confines himself strictly to the truth, but the
ever pertinent desire to excel, which is one great
incentive to progress, leads to exaggeration. For example:
the claim is sometimes made that they contain
more nutriment than the same quantity of beef.
Reference to Table <a href="#Page_61">V</a> does not bear out such a statement.
They contain more starch but less protein.</p>

<p>It is also claimed by some advertisers that breakfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
foods are brain and nerve foods. The idea that
certain foods are brain and nerve foods is erroneous,
except that any tissue-building food (protein) builds
nerve and brain tissue as it builds any other tissue,
and the foods which produce heat and energy for
other tissues produce the same for brain and nerve.</p>

<p>The grains commonly used for breakfast foods are
corn, oats, rice, and wheat. Barley, and wild rice, millet
and buckwheat are used in some sections, but not
enough to warrant discussion here.</p>

<p>Barley is used chiefly for making malt and in the
form of pearled barley is used in soups.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#Page_73">VI</a>, from one of the bulletins published
by the United States Department of Agriculture, is
interesting from an economical standpoint.</p>

<p>The less expensive breakfast foods, such as oatmeal
and corn meal, are as economical as flour, and, as they
supply heat and energy in abundance, as shown by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
Table <a href="#Page_73">VI</a>, they should be supplied in the diet in proportion
to the energy required. They are easily
prepared for porridge, requiring simply to be boiled
in water, with a little salt.</p>

<p>For invalids, children, and old people, breakfast
foods prepared in gruels and porridges are valuable
as they are easily digested. All should be thoroughly
cooked so as to break the cell-walls inclosing the
starch granules.</p>

<p><em>Oatmeal</em> is the most nutritious cereal. The oat contains
more fat than other grains and a larger proportion
of protein. It, therefore, contains the proportion
of nutrient elements best adapted to sustain life.</p>

<p>On account of the fat, oats are especially well
adapted for a breakfast food in winter. Another
advantage oatmeal, or rolled oats, have as a breakfast
food is in their laxative tendency, due to the coarse
shell of the kernel.</p>

<p>Oat breakfast foods keep longer than the foods made
from wheat and rice.</p>

<p>There are no malts, or any mixtures in the oat
preparations.</p>

<p>The difference between the various oatmeal breakfast
foods is in their manner of preparation. They
all contain the entire grain, with the exception of the
husk. They are simply the ground or crushed oat.
In preparing the oats before grinding, the outer hull
is removed, the fuzzy coating of the berry itself is
scoured off, the ends of the berry, particularly the
end containing the germ, which is usually the place
of deposit for insect eggs, is scoured, and the bitter
tip end of the oat berry is likewise removed.</p>

<p><em>Rolled oats</em> consist of the whole berry of the oat,
ground into a coarse meal, either between millstones,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
or, in the case of the so-called “steel cut” oatmeal,
cut with sharp steel knives across the sections of the
whole oat groat.</p>

<p><em>Quaker Oats</em> consist of the whole groats, which, after
steaming in order to soften, have been passed between
hot steel rolls, somewhat like a mangle in a laundry,
and crushed into large, thin, partially cooked flakes.
The oats are then further cooked by an open pan-drying
process. This roasting process insures that all
germ life is exterminated, renders the product capable
of quicker preparation for the table, and causes the
oil cells to release their contents, thereby producing
what is termed the “nut flavor,” which is not present
in the old-fashioned type of oat product.</p>

<p>Both Rolled Oats and Quaker Oats are now partially
cooked in their preparation, but the starch cells
must be thoroughly broken and they should be cooked
at least forty-five minutes in a double boiler; or, a
good way to prepare the porridge is to bring it to
the boiling point at night, let it stand covered over
night and then cook it from twenty to thirty minutes
in the morning. Another method of cooking is to
bring the porridge to the boiling point and then place
it in a fireless cooker over night.</p>

<p>The great fault in the preparation of any breakfast
food is in not cooking it sufficiently to break the starch
cells.</p>

<p><em>Puffed Rice</em> is made from a good quality of finished
rice. The process is a peculiar one, the outer covering
or bran, is removed and then the product is literally
“shot from guns”; that is, a quantity of the rice is
placed in metal retorts, revolved slowly in an oven,
at high temperature, until the pressure of steam, as
shown by a gauge on the gun, indicates that the steam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
generated slowly by the moisture within the grain
itself, has thoroughly softened the starch cells. The
gun retort is pointed into a wire cage and the cap
which closes one end is removed, permitting an inrush
of cold air. This cold air, on striking the hot steam,
causes expansion, which amounts practically to an
explosion. The expansion of steam within each
starch cell completely shatters the cell, causing the
grain to expand to eight times its original size. It
rushes out of the gun and into the cage with great
force, after which it is screened to remove all scorched
or imperfectly puffed grains.</p>

<p>This process dextrinizes a portion of the starch and
also very materially increases the amount of soluble
material as against the original proportion in the grain.</p>

<p><em>Puffed Wheat</em> is manufactured from Durum, or
macaroni wheat, of the very highest grade. This is
a very hard, glutinous grain. It is pearled in order to
thoroughly clean and take off the outer covering of
bran. It then goes through a puffing process, identical
with that of Puffed Rice. The chemical changes
are very similar to those of puffed rice.</p>

<p>Both Puffed Rice and Puffed Wheat are more digestible
than in the original grain state. They are valuable
foods for invalids.</p>

<p><em>Stale Bread.</em> A food which tastes much like a prepared
breakfast food, but is cheaper, may be made
by dipping stale bread into molasses and water, drying
it in the oven for several hours, and then crushing
it. It is then ready to serve with cream. This is a
palatable way to use up stale bread.</p>

<p><em>Crackers and Milk or Bread and Milk.</em> As noted
by Table <a href="#Page_73">VI</a>, crackers are similar to breakfast food
in nutrient elements, and with milk make a good food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
for breakfast, or a good luncheon. Business men,
and others who eat hurriedly and return immediately
to work, will do well to substitute crackers and milk,
or bread and milk, for the piece of pie which often
constitutes a busy man’s lunch.</p>

<p><em>Cracked Wheat.</em> In America wheat is seldom used
whole. In England the whole grain, with the bran
left on, is slightly crushed and served as cracked wheat
or wheat grits.</p>

<p>Wheat is also rolled, or flaked, or shredded. The
majority of wheat breakfast foods contain a part of
the middlings and many of them bran. Farina and
gluten preparations do not contain these, however.</p>

<p>The preparations of the various breakfast foods are
a secret of the manufacturers. The ready-to-eat
brands are cooked, then they are either rolled or
shredded, the shredding requiring special machinery
to tear the steamed kernels; later they are dried, and,
finally packed, sometimes in small biscuits. Many
preparations are baked after being steamed, which
turns them darker and makes them more crisp. Some
preparations are steamed, then run through rollers,
while still wet, and pressed into flakes or crackers.</p>

<p><em>Predigested Foods.</em> It is claimed that some foods
are “partly digested and thus valuable for those with
weak stomachs,” but breakfast foods are largely
starch and the starch is not digested by the gastric
juice. It is digested by saliva and the ferments in
the small intestine. These change the starch into
dextrin and maltose.</p>

<p>Experiments with “predigested” foods do not show
a larger proportion of dextrin (digested starch), however,
than would naturally be produced by the heating
of the starch when these foods are cooked at home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
The natural cooking makes starch more or less soluble,
or at least gelatinized. As a result of these experiments
therefore, the “predigested” argument is not of much
weight.</p>

<p>Predigested foods, except in cases in which the
patient is so weak as to be under the direction of a
physician, are not desirable. Nature requires every
organ to do the work intended for it, in order to keep
up its strength, just as she requires exercise for the
arms or legs to keep them strong. If an organ is
weak, the <em>cause</em> must be found and corrected—perhaps
the stomach or intestines need more blood, which
should be supplied through exercise; or perhaps the
nerves need relaxation; or the stomach less food; or
food at more regular intervals.</p>

<p>Another argument against predigested foods lies
in the fact that the chewing of coarse food is necessary
to keep the teeth strong. For this strengthening
of the teeth, children should be given dry crackers
or dry toast each day.</p>

<p>Dogs and wild animals which chew bones and hard
substances do not have pyorrhea, but lap-dogs and
animals in the zoos, fed on bread and meat without
bones, suffer from this disease.</p>

<p>In the so-called “predigested” or “malted” preparations,
malt is added while they are being cooked.</p>

<p><em>Malt</em> is a ferment made from some grain, usually
from barley, the grain being allowed to germinate
until the ferment diastase is developed.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a number of foods containing
malt are valuable to assist in converting starch
into dextrin or sugar, just as pepsin is an aid in the
digestion of protein; but eaten indiscriminately, there
can be no question that it is more important for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
teeth, stomach, and intestines to perform their natural
work and thus keep their strength through normal
exercise.</p>

<p>While they are not “predigested,” as claimed, these
foods are, as a rule, wholesome and nutritious. They
are cleanly, and made from good, sound grain, and
they contain no harmful ingredients. Some contain
“middlings,” molasses, glucose, and similar materials,
but these are in no way injurious and have value as
foods.</p>

<p>The dry, crisp, ready-to-eat foods are especially
advantageous because of the mastication they require.
This insures plenty of saliva being mixed with them
to aid in digestion. A dish of such dry breakfast
food, well masticated, together with an egg, to furnish
a larger proportion of protein, makes a wholesome
breakfast.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Cereal
Coffees</div>

<p>According to investigations made by
the United States Agriculture Experiment
Station, cereal coffees are made of parched
grains. A few contain a little true coffee, but for the
most part they are made of parched wheat, barley,
etc., or of grain mixed with wheat middlings, pea
hulls, or corn cobs. There is no objection to any of
these mixtures providing they are clean. The cereal
coffees, as seen by Table <a href="#Page_81">VII</a>, contain no more nourishment
than the true coffee, but they are probably
more easily digested; only a very little of the soluble
starch passes into the water unless the kernel is
ground. Coffee and tea are not taken for their nutrition,
but for their stimulating effect on the nerves;
and, if stimulation is desired, the cereal coffees fall
short.</p>

<br>

<p>By reference to Table <a href="#Page_81">VII</a> it will be seen that cocoa
and skimmed milk contain much more nutrition than
any of the coffees. The chief value of cereal coffees
is that they furnish a <em>warm</em> drink with the meal.
They should not be too hot.</p>

<p>Barley or wheat, mixed with a little molasses,
parched in the oven, and then ground, makes a mixture
similar to the cereal coffee.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned crust coffee is just as nutritious
as any of the coffees and has the advantage of being
cheaper.</p>

<p>Barley water and oat water, made by boiling the
ground kernel thoroughly and then straining, are
nourishing foods for invalids and children. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
often used as drinks by athletes and manual laborers,
as they have the advantage of both quenching thirst
and supplying energy.</p>

<p>Gruels are made in the same way, only strained
through a sieve. This process allows more of the
starch to pass with the water.</p>

<p>Like the cereals, they are seeds, yet they contain a
very much larger proportion of protein and may be
substituted for meat or eggs in a diet. In all vegetarian
diets, under normal conditions, the legumes should
be used freely to replace meats.</p>

<p>All legumes must be thoroughly cooked and thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
masticated. Because the protein in these
foods is less digestible than that in meat or eggs, particularly
if they are not thoroughly masticated, they
are better adapted for the use of those who do manual
labor. Soldiers in battle, day laborers, and others
whose work calls for hard physical exercise, can digest
legumes more easily than can those whose occupation
is more sedentary.</p>

<p>If not thoroughly masticated legumes usually
produce intestinal fermentation with consequent production
of gas. For this reason they occasion distress
in those who partake of them too freely and with
insufficient preparation by cooking.</p>

<p>The protein of the legumes is of the same nature
as the casein of milk. It has been called vegetable
casein.</p>

<p><em>Peanuts.</em> While an underground vegetable, grown
like potatoes, peanuts resemble nuts, inasmuch as
they contain so much fat. The extracted oil is used
in several commercial products.</p>

<p>Like other legumes, they require cooking. They
are roasted because this develops the flavor.</p>

<p>Because they contain a more balanced proportion
of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, they will sustain
life for some time without other food, as they provide
rebuilding material, energy, and heat. Used alone,
however, there is no counteracting acid, and it is
better to add some fruit, such as apples, or apples and
dates. For this reason lemon juice is mixed with
peanut butter.</p>

<p>In eating peanuts it is imperative that they be
masticated <em>until they are a pulp</em>, otherwise they are
very difficult of digestion. The pain which many
people experience after eating peanuts is probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
due to eating too large a quantity and not fully masticating
them, forgetting that they are a very rich,
highly concentrated food.</p>

<p>The habit of eating peanuts between meals and
then eating a hearty meal is likely to overload the
digestive organs.</p>

<p>Both peanuts and peanut butter contain over
twenty-five per cent. of protein and about thirty-nine
per cent. of fat; therefore they yield much heat
and energy.</p>

<p>Peanuts have been made into a flour; they are also
to be had in the form of grits which are cooked like
oatmeal. When nuts or peanuts are used as an after-dinner
relish the quantity of meat should be cut down.</p>

<p>Their popularity is evidenced by the fact that
between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 bushels are raised
annually in America.</p>

<p><em>Peanut Butter.</em> While peanut butter contains 46.5
per cent. fat, it contains only seventeen per cent. carbohydrates.
Since sugars and starches are protections
to fat, being used for energy before the fats are consumed,
if these sugars and starches are not supplied
in other food, the fats in the peanut butter are consumed
for energy. If starches <em>are</em> consumed in other
foods, it is clear that one who wishes to reduce in
flesh should avoid peanut butter, as well as other fats.</p>

<p>Peanut butter is more easily digested than the
roasted peanut, unless the latter is chewed to a pulp.
It can be made at home by grinding the peanuts in a
meat grinder, and then further mashing with a rolling
pin or a wooden potato masher. A little lemon juice
mixed with the peanut butter makes it not only more
palatable, but more easily digested. A peanut butter
sandwich is quite as nourishing as a meat sandwich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p><em>Shelled Peas.</em> Shelled peas were used in Europe as
far back as in the Middle Ages, and there, to-day, the
dried or “split” pea is used quite as extensively as the
dried bean. In America, peas are used almost entirely
in the green stage, fresh, or canned.</p>

<p>As seen by Table <a href="#Page_82">VIII</a>, the green, shelled pea contains
seven per cent. of protein and sixteen per cent.
of sugar and starch, while the dry or “split” pea
contains over 24.5 per cent. of protein and sixty-two
per cent. of sugar and starch, the difference being in
the amount of water contained in the shelled peas.
Canned peas contain even a larger percentage of
water.</p>

<p>A variety of the pea is now being cultivated, in
which, like the string bean, the pod is used as a food.
They are sweet and delicious.</p>

<p>Dried peas are used in this country mostly in purées.</p>

<p><em>Beans.</em> Baked navy beans may well be substituted
on a menu for meat, containing, as they do, 22.5 per
cent. of protein. It is needless to state that beans
and lean meat or eggs should not be served at the
same meal. Beans have the advantage of being
cheaper than meat, yet, as stated above, the protein
in the legumes is less easily digested than the protein
of meat or eggs. They must be thoroughly cooked
and thoroughly masticated.</p>

<p>There is but a small percentage of fat in dried beans;
for this reason they are usually baked with a piece
of pork. They make a very complete, perhaps the
most complete food, containing nutrient elements in
about the proper proportions.</p>

<p>A bean biscuit is used for the sustenance of soldiers
on a march; it gives a complete food in condensed
form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>In baking dried beans or peas, soft or distilled
water should be used, as the lime of hard water makes
the shell almost indigestible. Parboiling the beans
for fifteen minutes in two quarts of water with a
quarter of a teaspoon of baking soda softens the
shell, making them easier to digest.</p>

<p><em>String Beans.</em> The string bean contains very
little nutrition, as shown by Table <a href="#Page_82">VIII</a>. The pod
and the bean, at this unripe stage, contain nearly
ninety per cent. water. Their chief value as a food
consists in their appetizing quality to those who are
fond of them, thus stimulating the flow of gastric
juice.</p>

<p>Like all green vegetables they stimulate the action
of the kidneys. All green vegetables are particularly
valuable to those who drink little water.</p>

<p>The dried <em>Lima</em> bean, used during the winter, may
be boiled or baked. If old, they are practically
indigestible.</p>

<p><em>Kidney Beans</em> contain much water but are more
nutritious than the string bean.</p>

<p><em>Soy Bean.</em> In China and Japan this bean is used
extensively. Being rich in protein, used with rice
it makes a well-balanced diet.</p>

<p>The soy bean is made into various preparations,
one of the most important being <em>shoyo</em>, which has
been introduced into other countries. To make it,
the soy bean is cooked and mixed with roasted wheat
flour and salt; into this is put a special ferment.
It is then allowed to stand for an extended time in
casks. The result is a thick, brown liquid with a
pungent, agreeable taste. It is very nourishing.</p>

<p>A kind of cheese is also made by boiling the soy
bean for several hours, wrapping the hot mass in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
bundles of straw, and putting it in a tightly closed
cellar for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><em>Lentils</em> are not commonly used in this country, but
they were one of the earliest vegetables to be cultivated
in Asia and the Mediterranean countries. They
are usually imported and may be obtained in the
markets. They are used like dried peas and are
fully as nourishing, but the flavor of the lentil is
pronounced and they are not so agreeable to the
average person as peas or beans.</p>

equal proportion of proteins and carbonaceous

<p>It will be noted, by reference to Table <a href="#Page_87">IX</a> that
nuts contain a much larger proportion of fats and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
less starch than the legumes. Chestnuts contain the
largest amount of starch, and pecans the most fat.</p>

<p>Peanuts are classed here with nuts because of their
similar use in the diet. Their comparative richness
in protein will be noted.</p>

<p>Nuts are a valuable food, but they should be made
a part of a meal and may well take the place of meat
rather than eaten as a dessert, because of the large
percentage of protein. They are too rich to be eaten
as a relish at the end of a meal, if one has eaten as
much other food as the system requires.</p>

<p>In planning a meal, if the dietary is rich in starches
and lacking in protein, a side dish of nuts may be
served.</p>

<p>Too great stress cannot be laid on the importance
of the thorough mastication of nuts; otherwise they
are difficult of digestion. When thoroughly chewed,
however, they are as easily digested as cereals or
legumes. If ground fine in a meat grinder or rubbed
through a sieve, they digest more readily, but this
grinding does not take the place of the grinding with
the teeth and the mixture with the saliva. They are
best chopped for salads, cake, or croquettes. When
ground the oil extracted makes them pasty and
not appetizing in appearance for use in salads or
cake.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Milk</div>

<p>Milk is a perfect food for the infant
because it contains the elements in proper
proportions to sustain life and growth, though, alone,
it is insufficient for the nourishment of healthy adults.
The adult, in order to get sufficient nutriment, would
be compelled to take a larger proportion of water
than necessary, the proportion of water required by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the system being about sixty-seven per cent., while
milk contains eighty-seven per cent.</p>

<p>In many diseases, however, a whole or partial milk
diet is desirable, especially in any inflammatory condition
of the gastro-intestinal tract.</p>

<p>The milk of the cow is not perfectly adapted for
the young child—it is lacking in the proper proportion
of sugar, and when fed to the infant it must be modified.
Mother’s milk is not only richer in sugar than
cow’s milk, but it contains about half as much casein.
The calf needs more albumin than the baby does
because it grows faster. Human milk is also richer
in fat.</p>

<p>An all-milk diet may be followed when it is desirable
to gain in weight. Such a diet should be accompanied
by exercises for the vital organs and by deep
breathing, but experiments have shown that healthy
digestive organs do their work better when a part of
the food is solid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>A milk and cream diet of about three quarts milk
and one quart cream with the addition of one to two
eggs a day will keep up the strength of one in bed,
but is not sufficient for one who is active.</p>

<p>In order for an adult to obtain the proper quantity
of carbohydrates and fat, from an all-milk diet, it is
necessary for him to drink from four to five quarts of
milk a day (sixteen to twenty glasses). It is usually
said that on an all-milk diet an active person requires
as many quarts as he is feet tall.</p>

<p>Young babies on mother’s milk are almost always
fat, because of the larger proportion of sugar and fat
in the mother’s milk.</p>

<p>Reference to Table <a href="#Page_89">X</a> shows that the thirteen per
cent. of solids are about equally divided between fat,
sugar, and protein. The sugar is lactose. It supplies
heat to the infant before it can exercise its muscles
vigorously. The protein is casein.</p>

<p>There is no starch in milk. The digestive ferment,
which acts on starch, has not developed in the young
babe and it cannot digest starch.</p>

<p>The salts promote the growth of bone.</p>

<p>The fat in milk is in small emulsified droplets within
a thin albuminous sheath. When allowed to stand in
a cool place it rises to the top.</p>

<p>Besides casein, milk contains a certain amount of
albumin—about one-seventh of the total amount—called
lactalbumin. It maintains the fat in milk in
emulsified form.</p>

<p>In young babes the milk is curdled in the stomach,
or the casein separated from the water and sugar,
not by hydrochloric acid, but by a ferment in the
gastric juice, known as rennin. Rennin, or rennet,
from the stomachs of calves, is used in cheese and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
butter factories to coagulate the casein. This with
other chemicals so hardens the casein that it is used
in the manufacture of buttons.</p>

<p><em>Preserving milk.</em> If milk could be kept free from
bacteria, it would keep sweet almost indefinitely. At
the Paris Exposition, milk from several American
dairies was kept sweet for two weeks, without any
preservative except cleanliness and a temperature of
about forty degrees. The United States Bureau of
Animal Industry states that milk may be kept sweet
for seven weeks without the use of chemicals.</p>

<p>The importance of absolute cleanliness in the preparation
and marketing of this important article of
food is being recognized both by the producer and the
consumer, and careful inspection has done away with
many abuses. In the absence of an efficient health
department, the consumer should ascertain in every
case how the milk he uses is handled at every stage
before it reaches him. Care in this regard may safeguard
his family from disease and save him many
dollars.</p>

<p>The best method for the housewife to follow is to
keep the milk clean, cool, and away from other foods,
as milk will absorb a bad odor or flavor from any stale
food or odorous vegetables, from fresh paint, or other
substances.</p>

<p>Milk must never be left exposed in a sick room or
in a refrigerator unless the waste pipe and the ice
chamber are kept scrupulously clean.</p>

<p><em>Milk Tests.</em> In testing the value of milk, or the
value of a cow, butter makers and farmers gauge it
by the amount of butter fat in the milk, while the
cheese maker tests the milk for the proportion of
protein (casein). The amount of butter fat depends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
on the feed and water, and on the breed. If the total
nutrient elements fall below twelve per cent., it is
safe to assume that the milk has been watered.</p>

<p>In cheese and butter there is no sugar; it remains in
the buttermilk and the whey, both of which the farmer
takes home from the factories to fatten his hogs.</p>

<p><em>Pasteurized Milk.</em> In pasteurizing milk the aim is
to destroy as many of the bacteria as possible without
causing any chemical changes or without changing
the flavor. One can pasteurize milk at home by
placing it in an air-tight bottle, immersing the bottle
to the neck in hot water, heating the water to 167 F.
for twenty minutes, and then quickly cooling the milk
to 50 F. by immersing the bottle in cold water. The
rapid cooling lessens the cooked taste. The best
dairies pasteurize the milk before it is marketed.</p>

<p><em>Sterilized Milk.</em> Milk is sterilized to destroy all
bacteria, by heating it to 212 F. Sterilized milk
remains sweet longer than pasteurized milk, but more
chemical changes are produced and the flavor is
changed, resembling that of boiled milk.</p>

<p>Formerly borax, boric acid, salicylic acid, formalin,
and saltpeter were used to keep the milk sweet, but this
adulteration is now forbidden by the pure-food laws.</p>

<p><em>Malted milk</em> is a dry, soluble food product in powder
form, derived from malted barley, wheat flour (dextrin),
and cow’s milk, containing the full amount of
cream.</p>

<p>The process of the extraction from the cereals is
conducted at elevated temperatures so as to allow the
active agents (enzymes) of the barley malt to effect the
conversion of the vegetable protein and starches.
The filtered extract, containing the derivatives of the
malt, wheat, and the full-cream cow’s milk, is then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
evaporated to dryness <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</i>, the temperature being
controlled so as to obviate any alteration of the
natural constituents of the ingredients and so as to
preserve their full physiological values. The strictest
precautions are observed to insure the purity of the
product. It contains:</p>

<p>Malted milk is free from germs. The starches and
sugars are converted in the process of manufacture
into maltose, dextrin, and lactose. The fats are in an
absorbable condition, and it contains a high percentage
of proteins derived from both the milk and the grains,
as well as a marked percentage of mineral salts. It
is readily soluble in water and is easily digested.</p>

<p>The hydrochloric acid of the stomach coagulates
or curds milk much as it is curded by many fruit and
vegetable acids, such as those in lemons or tomatoes.
Thus the milk forms into curds immediately on entering
the stomach, the casein being at once precipitated
by the rennin. This is the chief reason why it should
be drunk slowly, otherwise too large curds will form,
causing distress from pressure.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Digestion
of Milk</div>

<p>A part of the digestion of the casein is
performed by pepsin in the stomach and
a part by the trypsin of the pancreatic juice.</p>

<p>The larger part of the digestion of the milk sugar
or lactose, is performed by the pancreatic juice; although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
it is partly acted on by the saliva. Usually,
however, the saliva is given little chance to become
mixed with the milk, unless it is taken slowly and
mixed with saliva by chewing movements. This is
one reason why children should be given milk in
which bread has been broken, rather than a piece of
bread and a glass of milk. By swallowing the milk
slowly, smaller curds are formed in the stomach and
the milk is more thoroughly digested.</p>

<p>The salts of milk, to a large extent, the water, and
perhaps a portion of the sugar are absorbed in the
stomach.</p>

<p>When the fat (cream) is removed milk digests more
readily, so that in cases in which the stomach is delicate,
<em>skimmed milk, clabbered milk, or buttermilk</em> are
often prescribed instead of sweet milk.</p>

<p>Boiled milk is also more readily digested by some;
the lactalbumin is separated and rises to the top in a
crinkly scum. The casein of boiled milk is also more
readily digested, forming in small flakes in the stomach
instead of in curds.</p>

<p>Sterilizing the milk by boiling will prevent the action
of bacteria in producing fermentation and disordered
digestion, and, if relished, milk can thus be treated.
Pasteurized milk is more palatable than boiled milk.</p>

<p>Milk is often better assimilated if other food is not
too suddenly cut off. When the diet is radically
changed the digestive system is apt to show derangement.
Therefore when for any cause an all-milk diet
is desired, it is unwise to begin it at once, by feeding
from eighteen to twenty glasses of milk a day. This
amount may be approximated within a week’s time.
The change in diet should be begun by cutting down
all meats and legumes and gradually eliminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
starches. In changing from a milk diet to a diet
including more hearty foods, the transition should
also be gradual.</p>

<p>If a milk diet is to be followed and the milk seems
to disturb the stomach when taken in quantities, one
may begin by taking it in very small quantities every
fifteen minutes for the first hour. If one’s purpose is
to gain in flesh the quantity may be increased to a
glass, and time intervals be lengthened to every hour
as the stomach becomes accustomed to caring for the
milk. It should be sipped slowly and thoroughly
mixed with saliva before being swallowed. The
mouth should be carefully rinsed with equal parts of
peroxide of hydrogen and water, or listerine and hot
sterile water, each time milk is taken.</p>

<p>Milk, in whatever form it is taken, leaves a coating
on the tongue and teeth. The heat of the mouth,
especially if the patient is feverish, quickly causes
changes which give a disagreeable taste and a chance
for bacterial action. These bacterial products are
carried into the stomach and excite digestive changes
through which fermentation and gas formation appear
and biliousness may result. This may be avoided if,
after taking the milk, the mouth is carefully washed
and, in feverish conditions, the tongue gently scraped
or swabbed with absorbent cotton dipped in listerine
or peroxide of hydrogen. Without such cleansing of
the mouth milk may disagree.</p>

<p>When from two to three glasses of milk at a meal are
taken, less solid food is needed, because the required
nutriment is partially supplied by the milk. One
reason why milk seems to disagree with many people,
is because they lose sight of the fact that milk is an
actual food, as well as a beverage, and they eat the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
usual quantity of food in addition to the milk. As
one pint, or two glasses of milk, contains approximately
the same amount of nutrition as one-third of a pound
of beef, the amount of food to be taken in addition
may be readily calculated.</p>

<p>The chief reason for the lessened activity of the
bowels on a milk diet is because the nourishment in
milk is practically all absorbed—there is very little
residue and milk gives little rough surface to excite
peristaltic action and stimulate the walls of the
intestine to activity.</p>

<p>The calcium, one of the constituents of milk, tends
to lessen the peristaltic action of the intestines and
this is one of the causes of constipation. Fruit and
coarse bread containing much bran, should be used
with a milk diet.</p>

<p>Constipation may also be occasioned by drinking
milk rapidly. When the hydrochloric acid is very
active coagulation may take place so quickly as to
cause hard tough curds to form; these enter the intestine
undissolved because the gastric juice can act
only on the exterior portion; the stomach retains the
curds in its effort to dissolve them and fermentation
may occur, with irritation and constipation from irregular
action. In this case the constipating effect
may be overcome by taking the milk in small sips or
by the addition of one part of limewater to six parts
milk. The limewater causes the curds to be precipitated
in small flakes.</p>

<p>Limewater may be prepared by putting a heaping
teaspoon of unslaked lime with a quart of boiled or
distilled water into a corked bottle or Mason jar.
Shake thoroughly two or three times during the first
hour; then allow the lime to settle, and after twenty-four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
hours pour or siphon off the clear fluid. Be
careful not to allow the lime to be poured off with the
water.</p>

<p>Barley water or oatmeal water added to milk also
prevents the formation of large curds.</p>

<p>Milk may also be taken with any variety of gruel—oatmeal,
sago, arrowroot, or tapioca.</p>

<p>If there is much mucus in the stomach, mucous
fermentation may occur in milk because of the lack
of hydrochloric acid. The partially digested curds
are tough, stringy, and slimy and the intestinal walls
find no resistance in the mass. In this case constipation
may be followed by diarrhea.</p>

<p>If the stomach is deficient in hydrochloric acid the
juice of half an orange or a little lemon juice may be
taken a half hour before the glass of milk.</p>

<p>Constipation and, later, diarrhea may also result
when stomach digestion is weak, the curds passing
through the stomach and intestines undissolved.</p>

<p>When there is any tendency to torpidity of the
liver, daily exercise should be directed to the liver,
stomach, and intestines or milk may cause biliousness,
because the excess of fat and protein taken overstimulates
the liver, causing an excess of bile. The
bile may enter the stomach and cause nausea and
vomiting. Constipation results from the disordered
digestion. This will not often occur if one exercises
daily and cuts down the quantity of solid food as the
amount of liquid is increased.</p>

<p>A glass of hot Vichy or Hunyadi water taken the
first thing on rising, and followed by a glass of cool
water will help to relieve any engorgement of the
liver.</p>

<p>In case of biliousness resulting from a milk diet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
abstain from all food for twenty-four hours, cleanse
the mouth as indicated above, and drink freely of
water.</p>

<p>When the liver is a little inactive, milk may be
diluted with an aërated water or even plain water.
Daily exercise directed toward securing a greater
activity of the liver and gall-bladder should be followed.
Four tablespoonfuls of soda water, Apollinaris,
or carbonic-acid water to the glass may be used.</p>

<p>As noted in the preceding pages, orange and lemon
juice will encourage greater activity of the stomach
and bowels.</p>

<p>One-third of a glass of hot Vichy water to each glass
of milk renders it easily digested and most people
relish it. Unless the liver is very inactive milk taken
in this way will not constipate and exercise directed
to the liver, as previously mentioned, will help to
obviate this condition.</p>

<p>Skimmed milk, Kumyss, or buttermilk are easily
digested and are valuable when the digestive system
is weak.</p>

<p>The monotony of a milk diet tends to create a
distaste for milk and the mental revolt may upset
digestion and result in constipation. This should be
kept in mind and various ways of modifying the
milk be used to create variety; mental aversion and
antagonism should be corrected.</p>

<p>When its taste is not relished milk may be made
acceptable and the stomach induced to retain it by
using a variety of flavors. A drop or two of vanilla,
a trifle of cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and pepper, chocolate,
or any other flavor that is liked may be used,
varying them so as to keep from monotony.</p>

<p>If milk seems to produce gas in the stomach with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
distress and the milk is retained too long in the stomach
from the interference with its movements caused by
the gas, a teaspoonful of malt extract may be added
to each glass of milk. If the malt extract is not at
hand, four teaspoonfuls of malted milk to each glass
may be used.</p>

<p>Equal parts of cream and hot water to which has
been added a third of a teaspoon of soda may be used,
for the same purpose.</p>

<p>If milk disagrees because of an excess of hydrochloric
acid and the formation of hard curds, a saltspoon
of salt or bicarbonate of soda may be used, or
one part of limewater to six parts of milk.</p>

<p>When milk seems to disagree because digestion is
somewhat slow and the milk does not offer enough
bulk to excite peristaltic action, it remains too long
in the stomach and fermentation occurs. A slice of
bread, a couple of crackers, a piece of zweiback, a
tablespoonful of Nestle’s or Mellin’s food or of arrowroot
gruel added to each glass, or eaten with the milk,
will give it more body and prevent the formation of
large curds.</p>

<p>When the stomach is excessively weak because of
a lack of the digestive juices and a consequent incomplete
action of the stomach, only predigested milk
should be taken until the stomach has been brought
to a normal tone. Pepsin or pancreatin may be
used for the partial digestion. Milk so predigested
must be freshly prepared each time it is used or must
be kept on ice until used. The stomach will find
practically no difficulty in assimilating milk thus
prepared, and constipation will be avoided.</p>

<p><em>It must be remembered that milk must be sipped slowly
and be well mixed with saliva before it is swallowed.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Milk can be soured and taken separated as a variation,
the curds and whey being relished by many when
properly prepared. A little sugar and cinnamon or
nutmeg sprinkled on curds or mixed with the whey
make a palatable mixture. Buttermilk or kumyss
offer still other variations.</p>

<p>With all these means of varying the taste, appearance,
or condition of milk it is hardly possible that
some way cannot be found whereby milk may be
taken and be well borne by the stomach and the full
benefits from its use be derived.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Cheese</div>

<p>This is the casein (protein) which has
been separated from milk by the action of
rennet. It is highly nutritious and many varieties
are on the market. In Europe it is largely used to
take the place of meat. Cheese contains almost as
much again protein as is contained in the same quantity
of meat.</p>

<p>In this country more highly flavored cheeses are in
demand, and when eaten in moderate quantities they
aid digestion. They are highly concentrated food
and but a small quantity should be eaten at a meal,
particularly if meat has constituted a part of the meal.</p>

<p>The cheeses poor in fat are more difficult to digest
as they are harder and not so easily masticated.</p>

<p>Contrary to the prevalent idea, a properly made
Welsh rarebit is more easily digested than uncooked
cheese.</p>

<p>One should use judgment, in eating any highly
concentrated food, not to eat too large a quantity.</p>

<p><em>Smierkase</em>, or cottage cheese, is coagulated casein.
It contains thirty-three per cent. of protein, twenty-four
per cent. of fat, and five per cent. of salts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>The thickening of the milk, or the coagulation of
the casein, is like that produced by lactic acid.</p>

<p><em>Skimmed milk</em>, as shown by the table, contains
the same amount of protein as fresh milk, but more
sugar and more ash, the difference consisting almost
entirely of less fat, which has been removed in the
cream.</p>

<p><em>Buttermilk.</em> There is less fat, protein, sugar, or ash
in buttermilk than in skimmed milk; it is therefore
less nourishing, but it requires less digestive effort.
The sugar has partially fermented and the lactic acid
is freed. It is the free lactic acid which gives the
pungent taste.</p>

<p>Buttermilk made by lactone or Bulgarian tablets
and fresh milk is as nourishing and as desirable as
that made in the process of butter making, and it has
the advantage of being fresh. When the whole milk
is used it, of course, contains the same amount of fat,
protein, sugar, and ash as the milk. It is of value
in cases of poor digestion of protein and fat, and in
chronic stomach trouble. It has been claimed that
the bacilli in buttermilk made from the Bulgarian
tablets prevent putrefaction in the large intestine.
This is disputed, however.</p>

<p><em>Clabbered Milk.</em> The casein in clabbered milk
coagulates and if kept in a hot place the coagulation
continues until the water, sugar, and salts are
separated. Clabbered or loppered milk is wholesome.
It may be sweetened or salted and flavored
to taste.</p>

<p><em>Whey</em> is the watery portion of milk from which the
casein has been removed in the process of making
cheese. It is a palatable drink and may be flavored
with a little nutmeg and sugar or salt. Invalids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
usually relish it. Beef tea or egg yolk may be added
to it.</p>

<p><em>Milk Sugar.</em> Sugar made from milk is now a commercial
product; it is evaporated and transformed
into a fine powder. This powder is used by physicians
and druggists in compounding powders, pills,
tablets, etc.</p>

<p><em>Junket.</em> The tablets used in making junket are
the essence of rennet. Milk coagulated by rennin
has not the sour taste of milk coagulated by acid.
It is an admirable article of diet in many weakened
conditions of the digestive tract.</p>

<p><em>Condensed Milk</em> is made by evaporating the water
until it is reduced to about sixty-one per cent. It is
then hermetically sealed. It is convenient for use
whenever fresh milk cannot be obtained, but the
process of evaporation changes its flavor so that few
care for it as a drink. It may be substituted for
cream in coffee, and diluted with three times its volume
in water the proportions are again the same as before
the water was evaporated.</p>

<span class="fs80">BEVERAGES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Beverages</span> are used primarily to relieve thirst;
they may also contain food elements; they may
be used for their effect in heat and cold, for their
flavor, which helps to increase the appetite, or for
their stimulating properties.</p>

<p>They are used to aid digestion and the elimination
of waste, to promote sweating, to soothe inflamed
air passages or digestive membranes. They furnish
extra nutrition, stimulate nerve action, quench thirst
in fevers, warm the body when it is cold or cool it
when it is hot. They are used in health or disease,
from the snows of the arctics to the palms of the tropics.
They may be alkaline or acid, mineral, medicated or
mucilaginous, effervescing or plain. The question of
their utility and preparation is important in any
discussion of foods and food products, though in
themselves they are not foods.</p>

<p>The people of all races seemingly crave a stimulant,
after bodily or mental exertion, in fatigue, as a
“bracer” in prolonged effort, as a promoter of
sociability, or as an offering of hospitality. These
stimulants are either alcoholic or non-alcoholic.</p>

<p>It is a notable fact that no tribe is so remote that
it does not possess some form of beverage which may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
be offered to friends or used to promote feelings of
conviviality; or it may be used to stir up rage if
onslaughts against neighboring tribes are contemplated.
The craving is universal and as old as the
race.</p>

<p>Those who decry this craving when it takes the
form of alcohol are often themselves addicted to excessive
drinking of non-alcoholic stimulants.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Tea</div>

<p>Tea is not a food—it is a stimulant. It
is made by steeping the leaves of a shrub,
called Thea, which grows in the tropical regions of
Asia and adjacent islands.</p>

<p>Green tea differs from black in the mode of its
preparation. In green tea the leaves are steamed
before they are dried.</p>

<p>The amount of tannin in green tea is greater than
in black, hence green tea is regarded as not so wholesome
a drink as black tea.</p>

<p>The young tender leaves are more delicate of flavor.</p>

<p>Varieties of plants differ both in the amount of
tannin and the delicacy of flavor.</p>

<p>Tea should never be boiled or allowed to stand
longer than a few minutes; standing causes the tannin
to be extracted from the leaves, and this tannin disturbs
digestion. It is the tannin extracted from the
bark of trees which toughens animal skins into leather.</p>

<p>The best way to make tea is to pour on boiling
water and serve within five minutes.</p>

<p>Because of the uncertainty as to the length of time
tea may be allowed to steep in hotel kitchens or restaurants,
it is a wise custom to have a ball of tea
and a pot of hot water served that the guest may
make the tea at the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>Tea is diuretic, stimulating the action of the kidneys.
Through its stimulant action it relieves fatigue
and has been found especially useful in Arctic explorations
and for soldiers on long marches.</p>

<p>When taken hot it will often relieve sick headache.
When taken on an empty stomach, after a long fatiguing
tramp or a prolonged “shopping” excursion,
its refreshing effect may be felt for an hour or two.</p>

<p>The ease of its preparation and the quickness of its
effect tends to produce the “tea habit.” When drunk
to excess with meals, it causes the precipitation of the
ferments in the digestive juices, retards digestion, and
may cause constipation, particularly if taken after
long infusion.</p>

<p>Strong tea has an overstimulating effect on the
nervous system which reacts, producing depression
and restlessness; this may lead to insomnia, muscular
twitchings, and palpitation of the heart.</p>

<p>Habitual users often take from ten to twenty cups
of strong tea daily; in these the evil effects of the tea
habit are easily noted.</p>

<p>Americans, or any people whose nerves are highly
stimulated, from the stress of life, or from habitual
nerve tension, should particularly avoid all stimulating
beverages.</p>

<p>Poor tea, because of the greater amount of tannin
it contains, produces its ill effects more quickly.
From overstimulation of the nervous system, poor
tea, long stewed, has been held to be a contributing
factor in insanity.</p>

<p>Tea should be avoided by the dyspeptic, by those
of constipated and flatulent habit, or by the anemic.</p>

<p>Tannin coagulates the albumin in milk or cream
and the addition of these to tea renders it more indigestible;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
plain or with lemon juice it may be well
borne by those with whom it disagrees when used
with cream or sugar.</p>

<p><em>Thein</em>, the active principle in tea, is chemically
identical with caffein in coffee.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Coffee</div>

<p>Coffee is prepared from the seeds of the
coffee tree. The best known brands come
from the Island of Java, Mocha, Rio de Janeiro, and
Mexico.</p>

<p>Coffee, like tea, <em>is not a food</em>, it is a stimulant.</p>

<p>The active principle is caffein. This is an alkaloid
and is a strong stimulant to the central nervous
system. It quickens the heart action, and the stimulating
effect is so apparent with many, that they cannot
sleep for several hours after drinking it. Others
drink coffee to quicken mental activity and to keep
them awake.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, however, that there is
a reactionary effect from all stimulants, and while
coffee is not intoxicating, as alcohol, it has a similar
effect on the nerves and heart.</p>

<p>Coffee has the redeeming feature of having a pleasing
aroma, which, because of the effect on the mind,
may incite the flow of gastric juice. Despite the fact
that no morning beverage has quite the same pleasing
aroma, or pungency, ordinarily one is much better
without it.</p>

<p>Coffee stimulates the action of the heart and for
this reason it is used in collapse to restore heart
action.</p>

<p>It removes the sense of fatigue and is thus beneficial
in some cases, as in the army, when long marches are
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>It is valuable as an antidote in opium poisoning or
in cases of alcoholism.</p>

<p>It is given to those addicted to liquor, as a milder
stimulant when they are recovering from a spell of
intoxication.</p>

<p>The only use of coffee as a food is that its pleasant
aroma stimulates the flow of gastric juice.</p>

<p>Strong coffee, particularly that which has been
boiled for a long time, retards digestion, and, if much
is drunk, it will produce the same symptoms of over
stimulation of the nervous system as are manifest
in the tea habit. Heartburn, constipation, dyspepsia,
and insomnia may result.</p>

<p>Sometimes the habit is manifested by excessive eating
of the coffee bean. Such users show marked
symptoms of nervousness; they are usually thin and
their faces are drawn and anxious.</p>

<p>Each person must decide for himself whether or not
coffee or tea is injurious to him and cease the habit
if he finds it is interfering with the proper functioning
of the system, remembering always that the purpose
of food is to resupply body waste and produce
heat and energy.</p>

<p>One who knows that coffee disturbs his digestion,
and yet cannot break himself from the habit of drinking
it, should have sympathy for the one who is
addicted to liquor and finds it difficult to break the
habit of depending on this <em>so-called</em> stimulant.</p>

<p><em>Cereal Coffee</em> has been discussed under the heading
“Cereals.”</p>

<p>“Crust” coffee is made by pouring boiling water
on “caramelized” bread or bread deeply toasted,
allowing it to stand ten minutes, then pouring off
the liquid, which may be sweetened to taste or mixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
with cream or milk. It is also made by using crusts
of bread which have been dried in the oven without
being allowed to brown.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Cocoa and
Chocolate</div>

<p><em>Cocoa and Chocolate</em> are prepared from
the cocoa bean.</p>

<p>Cocoa is from the shell of the bean and
chocolate from the kernel. As shown by Table <a href="#Page_81">VII</a>,
they are more nutritious than the other beverages.</p>

<p>Cocoa butter is the fat of the cocoa bean. It has
a pleasant odor and does not easily become rancid.
Its nutritive value depends on its fat.</p>

<p>Most of the fat has been removed from the cocoa
made for the use of invalids, hence the nutritive value
of this cocoa is lessened. The milk and sugar used
in its preparation constitute the most of its nourishment;
the cocoa simply gives a flavor.</p>

<p>Part of the value of chocolate is in the sugar used
with it. If well prepared it is digested with ease and
forms a nutritious article of diet. The habit of using
large amounts of chocolate in candy, or as a beverage,
disorders the system because of the gastric disturbances
produced by the excess of sugar.</p>

<p>When food is not easily obtained, compressed cakes
of chocolate may be carried, as in traveling, for a
temporary food supply.</p>

<p>Chocolate, as sugar, in moderation, constitutes a
good food for the growing child.</p>

<p>The active principle in cocoa and chocolate is <em>theobromin</em>
and, though milder, is similar to caffein in its
stimulating effect on the nervous system.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Lemonade</div>

<p><em>Lemonade</em> and other fruit drinks, particularly
those made from the citrus fruits,
slake the thirst more quickly than most drinks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>All fruit drinks are diuretic, and, whenever the action
of the kidneys is sluggish, they are especially desirable.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Effervescing
Waters</div>

<p>These are made by forcing carbon dioxid,
under pressure, into the bottle. As soon
as the cork is removed the escape of the
gas causes effervescence. These drinks are of no
special advantage, other than that they slake the
thirst, because the amount of salts of various minerals
they contain is usually small.</p>

<p>When taken in excess they cause flatulence and
may lead to gastric disturbances. The indiscriminate
habit of young people drinking effervescing waters
at soda fountains should be discouraged.</p>

<p>These waters added to milk render it more easily
digested.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Water</div>

<p>There is no beverage nor concoction
devised by man equal to water. It is to
be deplored that it is not used as freely as Nature
demands—from eight to ten glasses a day.</p>

<p>The value of water as a food and as an aid to digestion
is discussed on page <a href="#Page_26">26</a>.</p>


<h3><em>CONDIMENTS</em></h3>

<p>Condiments are not foods. They have no nutrition
in themselves, but by their flavor they stimulate
the nerves of taste, rendering the food more appetizing
and help to make the diet more varied.</p>

<p>They are relishes and are to be employed in this
manner judiciously, and not used generally in the diet.</p>

<p>Some strong condiments, as cayenne pepper, are
of use in dyspeptic conditions to stimulate the gastric
mucous membrane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>They are of value in the dietary of the invalid
whose appetite must be stimulated and careful variations
in flavoring will aid in varying a diet which
otherwise would be monotonous, but the excessive
use of condiments, particularly the various peppers,
salt, horseradish, ginger, vinegar, and spices, as indulged
by many, so overstimulates the gastric and
intestinal membranes, as to cause catarrhal disease
and dyspepsia. They tend to weaken digestion by
calling for an undue secretion of digestive juices,
which, if prolonged, tires out the glands.</p>

<p>The use of salts is discussed on pages <a href="#Page_34">34-37</a>.</p>

<p>A reasonable amount of condiments such as pepper,
salt, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, sage, thyme, ginger,
mustard, cinnamon, mace, horseradish, vanilla, dill,
etc., may be used as appetizers, because the pleasing
thought of them may incite the flow of gastric juice;
but they should not be used to excess.</p>

<p>The taste is undoubtedly a cultivated one, and
should not be encouraged in children. The child
rarely cares for condiments and it is better that he
continue to relish his food in its natural flavor.</p>

<p>If beef tea, which so soon becomes distasteful to
the sick, is flavored with different savory or aromatic
substances, as parsley, sage, or mint, it is taken with
greater relish.</p>

<p><em>Mustard</em>, so commonly used with cold ham or other
meat and in salad dressing, is sometimes of benefit
in stimulating the appetite, but when used in large
quantities, or continuously, it may irritate the stomach.
This irritant quality may be used to advantage, when
it is deemed necessary, as a counter-irritant on the
skin, as in the well-known mustard plaster. A teaspoonful
of mustard to a pint of lukewarm water is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
an effectual emetic in cases in which it is necessary
or advisable to empty the stomach.</p>

<p><em>Capers</em>, the flower buds of a bush grown in the
East, are put up in vinegar and used in sauces for
mutton.</p>

<p><em>Cinnamon</em>, <em>nutmeg</em>, and <em>cloves</em> are useful in flavoring
foods; they take the flat taste from hot water and
impart a pleasant spiciness. Many can take milk
when flavored, and the slight amount necessary is in
no way injurious.</p>

<p><em>Preserved ginger</em> is of value for flavoring cereal foods
and gruels for invalids.</p>

<p><em>Vinegar</em>, used in excess, reduces the alkalinity of
the blood and aids in the destruction of red blood
corpuscles. It may thus produce anemia when used
in excess.</p>

<p>The acetic acid contained in <em>cider vinegar</em> aids the
softening of the muscle fiber of meat and thus facilitates
its digestion. Because of its preservative qualities
it is used in pickling vegetables and various kinds
of fish.</p>

<p>Vinegars made from grapes or other fruits are wholesome.
Flavored vinegars, as tarragon, from the
herb of the same name, are useful as appetizers.</p>

<p>Vinegars artificially made from commercial acids
are sometimes injurious.</p>

<p><em>Tomato Catsup</em>, <em>Worcestershire</em>, and <em>Tabasco sauces</em>
are not harmful if used moderately and with due regard
to enhancing not destroying the flavor of the food
with which they are used.</p>


<h3><em>PRESERVATION OF FOODS</em></h3>

<p>This subject is of ever-growing importance. The
study of the preservation of foods has added much to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the store of human knowledge. By this means it is
possible for those living in districts remote from the
supply, those who cannot afford to buy them fresh,
and those who have no cellars in which to store them,
to have vegetables and fruits at all seasons of the year.</p>

<p>Nutritious foods can be prepared in such small
bulk and of such excellent keeping quality that explorers,
whether to the arctics or the tropics, can
be kept in first-class physical condition, enabled to
withstand fatigue, and be removed to long distances
from the base of supplies without great hardship.</p>

<p>The decomposition of food is occasioned by bacterial
action. Air is necessary to the growth of bacteria.
If the air is excluded the ordinary bacteria are
prevented from exerting their deleterious action.</p>

<p>Heat, as in canning, prevents the formation of
bacterial products.</p>

<p>Cold, in refrigeration, by inhibiting bacterial activity
is also an excellent preservative.</p>

<p>Other methods in use are smoking, salting, drying,
sterilizing, various antiseptics, and the exclusion of
the air, as in coating eggs or meat for transportation
to other countries.</p>

<p>Eggs are preserved for a long period by excluding
the air, which otherwise penetrates the shell. A solution
of water glass (silicate of sodium), dry oats or
salt are used for this purpose.</p>

<p>All food intended for preservation should be kept
in a clean, cool, dry, dark place.</p>

<p>Drying, cooking, and sealing from the air will
preserve some meats and fruits, while others require
such preservatives as sugar, vinegar, and salt. The
preservative in cider vinegar is acetic acid, in wine
vinegar tartaric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>All preservatives which are actual foods, such as
sugar, salt, and vinegar, are to be recommended, but
the use of antiseptic preservatives, such as salicylic
acid, formaldehyd, boracic acid, alum, sulphur, and
benzoate of soda, all of which have been used by
many canning merchants, is fraught with danger.
By the efforts of the United States Department of
Agriculture the use of such preservatives has been
largely done away with by the most reliable packers
and canners. However, unscrupulous dealers may
use this means of disguising fruits and vegetables not
in good condition.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, that, whenever possible,
the best method is for the housewife to preserve her
own food by drying, canning, preserving, and pickling,
with fruits and vegetables which she knows are fresh.
This, however, is not always practicable.</p>

<p>Since economy in food lies in obtaining the greatest
amount of nutriment for the least money, the preparation
of simple foods in the home, with care that no
more is furnished for consumption than the system
requires, is the truest economy.</p>

<p>More brands of prepared food are not so much
needed as purity of elements in their natural state.</p>

<p><em>In the effort to emphasize the importance of pure
food in amount and quality, pure air and pure water
must not be overlooked. Much infection is carried by
these two elements.</em></p>


<h3><em>POISONING FROM FOOD</em></h3>

<p>Owing to the careful inspection given to various
preparations of foods and the education of the people
on the dangers attending the eating of underripe,
overripe, or fermenting fruits and vegetables, or decomposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
canned meats or other foods, cases of
poisoning from food are not so numerous as formerly.</p>

<p>One still reads, however, of illnesses and even fatalities
in those who have, at some gathering, partaken
of potted or canned meats, or ice-cream made from
impure milk.</p>

<p>Imperfect sterilization allows the micro-organisms,
everywhere present in the atmosphere, to multiply
and produce their toxins.</p>

<p>Any food contained in a can which shows a suspicious
bulging in top or sides (not a dent caused by
handling) should be unhesitatingly rejected, for fermentation
has developed gases, which, in trying to
escape, have caused the bulging. Though the practice
is less common than formerly, some grocers offer
these bulging cans for sale at less prices and they are
thus purchased by those who look for bargains in
foods instead of for quality.</p>

<p>Sometimes the foods have not advanced to a stage
in which the poisonous products are manifested; but
in the intestinal canal the germs contained in these
foods manufacture toxins which are readily absorbed
and produce the severe disturbances noted in cases
of ptomain poisoning.</p>

<p>The liver, which has been styled the “watchdog of
the body,” has a special power to destroy many of
the toxins contained in the food material passing
through it, and it is due to this fact that many deleterious
substances, taken with the food, are neutralized
and their poisons rendered harmless to the system.
When the liver is disordered, this important function
may be hindered, or cease to be active. Therefore,
the importance may be readily seen of keeping the
liver in a vigorous condition by means of exercises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
which will send an active circulation through it and
keep the nerves controlling it in perfect functioning
order.</p>

<p>Ptomain poisoning results most often from tainted
meat, milk, and fish. Putrefactive processes may have
begun in meat, which is thus rendered “high,” but
if it is thoroughly cooked the poisons may be made
inert. Many enjoy the flavor of such meat. The
Eskimos, as is well known, will cache a seal or other
animal against a time when food is less plentiful and
after months, perhaps, will eat it with relish and without
harm, though it cannot be touched by people with
less hearty appetites. Old eggs, eaten as a luxury by
the Chinese, and the fermented fish used by other
races are familiar examples of tainted foods.</p>

<p>The sale of “bob” veal, or the flesh of very young
calves, has been prohibited because in many people
its ready decomposition causes active diarrhea.</p>

<p>The process of smoking various meats affects materially
only the outside portion, the inner may furnish
a suitable bed for the development of germs. Great
care should be exercised and thorough inspection
made of any meat which is eaten raw, as dried beef,
or any pork product.</p>

<p>Ice-cream, as made in the home, is usually innocuous,
but when it is made in factories, unless care is exercised
to keep containers clean and sterilized, the cream or
milk may become infected from careless handling,
either before or after it reaches the factory—particularly
in warm weather. Toxins which cause serious
and often fatal poisoning develop. Many such cases
have resulted from the free eating of infected ice-cream
at picnics or other social gatherings.</p>

<p>One should guard against overripe cheese, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
cheese of any kind acts as a poison with some people.
Cases of severe intestinal disturbance may occur in
those who are unable to eat certain articles of food,
as strawberries, lobsters, or oysters; these attacks
should be carefully distinguished from cases of true
poisoning.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, particularly in the case of fish
or oysters which have been frozen, unless they are
eaten immediately after they have been thawed,
toxins develop which cause severe constitutional
disturbance, particularly of the nervous system.
These toxins do not seem to affect the gastro-intestinal
tract so markedly. Infected shellfish, particularly
mussels, have caused death in two hours by their
effect on the nervous system.</p>

<p>Many fish after being smoked are eaten raw, and
if the ptomains have begun to develop, poisoning
follows.</p>

<p>Care must be taken in purchasing fish for the table
that the flesh is firm and the odor absolutely without
taint.</p>

<p>Meat or fish may become toxic to the system through
substances eaten by the animal or by its own physical
condition at the time it is killed. Fish and oysters,
therefore, are not eaten during the spawning season.</p>

<p>Cow’s milk may be made obnoxious by substances
on which the cow feeds. Wild garlic when eaten by
the cow imparts a nauseous taste to the milk.</p>

<p>The flesh from diseased animals slaughtered and
sold for food has occasioned violent sickness. Government
inspection, however, has greatly lessened the
dangers from this source.</p>

<p>Unripe or overripe vegetables and fruit may occasion
severe vomiting and diarrhea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Moldy flour contains a substance which may cause
poisoning.</p>

<p>Rye may have a parasite fungus called ergot and if
flour is made from rye contaminated with this growth,
a form of poisoning called “ergotism” may result.
It takes some time and a prolonged use of the flour
to cause untoward symptoms.</p>

<p>Pellagra, which has been giving the southern states
so much trouble, was thought to be caused by the use
of spoiled corn meal. It is now thought to be due to
the disturbed nutrition following too monotonous
and unbalanced a diet. The excessive use of corn-meal
breads with their heating qualities and the irritation
of the intestinal canal may be an accessory
factor.</p>

<p>A food which is so universally used as milk should
be surrounded with every safeguard possible by rigid
inspection from producer to consumer, as many infective
epidemics have been traced directly to a careless
or infected handler of this product. Tuberculosis
and typhoid fever germs, diphtheria and scarlet fever
may all be communicated by this means. Live
typhoid bacilli have been found in acid buttermilk.
Infected water used in washing the cans will infect
the milk.</p>

<p>Other poisoning may occur by the tin or lead in the
inside of cans being dissolved off by the acids in fruits
or vegetables. This is more likely to occur when the
cans of fruit have been kept for a long time. Housekeepers,
who use tin cans, should not put up more
fruit than will supply the family for the season.</p>

<p>Tomatoes, asparagus, strawberries, and apricots
are especially liable to dissolve the tin from the can.</p>

<p>Food should be emptied from the can as soon as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
is opened, as the action of the air hastens deterioration.
No cooked fruit should be allowed to stand in a tin
saucepan or other vessel. It should be emptied as
soon as the cooking process is complete.</p>

<p>When a can of fruit, vegetables, or meat is opened,
if the interior of the can is even partially black, it is
safe to reject the contents. The tin in the food will
be absorbed in the intestinal tract and may cause
severe disturbance.</p>

<p>Large canners of fruit and vegetables, of the better
quality, are now coating the inside of the can with
an insoluble varnish which prevents the acids from
acting on the tin.</p>

<p>The best canners are exceedingly careful and everything
in their factories is scrupulously clean.</p>


<h3><em>THE ADULTERATION OF FOOD</em></h3>

<p>Laws against food adulteration have been enacted,
but unscrupulous manufacturers find ways to evade
them. On account of these laws, however, the practice
is less general and manufacturers are beginning
to take pride in putting up goods that pass the strictest
inspection. The people, also, are being aroused,
through the efforts of the pure-food propagandists,
to the ill effects of adulterated foods both on the body
and the pocketbook and are increasingly demanding
that the foods they buy shall be pure and wholesome.</p>

<p>To lessen the cost of production, many foods are
mixed with various substances before being marketed
in order to increase the profits of the manufacturer
or dealer. The contained substance may not be
deleterious to health, but it may lessen the value of
the article as a food.</p>

<p>Among foods which may be so adulterated are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
jellies, jams and marmalades, catsups and pickles of
all varieties, baking powder, butter, spices, coffee,
corn-starch, mincemeat, vinegar, syrups, sugar, honey,
lard, and flour.</p>

<p>Various adulterants which are used are: wood
alcohol (a poison) in flavoring extracts; vinegar made
from various acids and colored to imitate cider vinegar;
rice flour and wheat flour used in ground spices;
kaolin and coloring matter used in candies; paraffin
in gum drops; glucose artificially flavored as maple
syrup; cotton-seed oil sold as olive oil; starch and
sugar in powdered cocoa and in chocolate; chicory,
sugar, and pea meal in ground coffee; artificial coffee
beans made of starch, molasses, and chicory; alum and
ammonia in baking powders; artificial coloring of
canned peas, beans, and catsups, butter, cheese, milk,
and cream.</p>

<p>It must be said, in justice, however, that housewives
are responsible for many of these productions.
Dealers who would be glad to sell only pure articles
say that “the trade won’t have them.”</p>

<p>Many insist on a highly colored cheese, thinking
that the color denotes greater richness, whereas a little
reasoning would show them that the richest old cheeses
are pale in color, the deeper color of the cheese being
due to the addition of coloring matter to the curd.
While the coloring matter is not deleterious, the color
is no evidence of richness.</p>

<p>Highly colored green pickles, beans, and peas, should
not be used. Pickles which are hard and crisp are
usually made so by alum.</p>

<p>Brilliant red catsup is in demand, though the pure
variety is known by its darker and not so attractive
hue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>High coloring in any canned fruit or vegetable is
usually an indication that dye stuffs have been used
to produce it.</p>

<p>Fruit jams which are of nondescript color or pale
when pure are colored artificially because the ordinary
purchaser demands a pretty product.</p>

<p>Through the vigilance of the food inspectors of the
boards of health, and because of some vigorous prosecutions,
the adulteration of the people’s food is, however,
not so easy and profitable an occupation as
formerly.</p>

<p>The Bulletins of the Department of Agriculture
furnish a mine of wealth in the gaining of knowledge
of various foods and their preparation, and may be
had free on application to this Department at Washington.</p>


<h3><em>HEAT AND ENERGY</em></h3>

<p>The second use of foods, as mentioned before, is
to furnish heat and energy for the work of the body.
Heat and energy are produced <em>automatically</em> by the
action of the heart, the movement of the lungs in
breathing, and by muscular activity through the digestion,
absorption, and assimilation of food elements,
and through the activity in tearing down and eliminating
waste. They are produced <em>consciously</em> by
muscular activity in exercise.</p>

<p>Just as any engine requires fuel, water, and air to
create the force necessary to run the machinery, so
does the human engine require fuel, air, and water.</p>

<p>The fuel for an engine consists of coal, wood, or oil.
As these are brought in combination with oxygen,
combustion or oxidation takes place, liberating heat
and setting the engine in motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>The amount of energy or force given off by an
engine should exactly equal the amount of latent
energy provided in the fuel. Much of this energy is
commercially lost, since much of the latent force in
fuel is not fully liberated, some passing off in the
smoke, while some may remain in the cinders.</p>

<p>The amount of heat and energy generated by the
body equals the amount of latent energy released by
the burning of food material during oxidation.</p>

<p>The carbohydrates and fats constitute the most of
the fuel.</p>

<p>The body cells are constantly surrounded by the
lymph which contains the food material—the protein,
the carbohydrate, and the fat.</p>

<p>The lymph carries all of the food elements, therefore
the protein, the fat, and the carbohydrate reach
the tissues at the same time. If the fat and carbohydrate
predominate, their excess serves to keep a
portion of the protein away from the cells. The cells
can use carbohydrate more easily than fat, so the
surplus amount of carbohydrate is first used to produce
energy. This spares the protein which is held
in reserve for tissue repair, and the fat, being least
readily used, is stored.</p>

<p>When the carbohydrates and fats are not supplied,
or when the system fails for any reason to appropriate
those eaten to its use, the protein is used for heat and
energy instead of being used for tissue building. If
the demand, either in mental or physical energy,
exceeds the daily supply for long, the body becomes
lean.</p>

<p>In order, therefore, to maintain a perfect equilibrium
the supply of protein, carbohydrate, and fat
should bear the proper relation, any excess at one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
time being equalized at another. If an overhearty
meal is eaten the next should be light.</p>

<p>Fat is harder to burn than the starches and sugars
so that they are acted on first as an economy of effort,
and the fat is held in reserve until the carbohydrates
are exhausted.</p>

<p>If one is cold, the quickest way to get warm is to generate
more heat within by “turning on the draught,”
or, in other words, by <em>breathing in more oxygen</em>. If
cold, one should depend more on the oxygen within
than on extra clothing. So many people put on more
clothing to conserve the body heat and forget to
generate more heat by arousing the fires within.
This is like covering a dying fire, instead of turning
on the draught to create more combustion.</p>

<p>The carbon in the body is burned by being brought
into contact with oxygen in the blood through exercise
and full breathing, just as a fire is fanned to flame by
bringing oxygen in contact with the fuel, by means of
a draught of air. Keep all air away from a fire and
it “dies out,” it has exhausted the oxygen and no
heat is produced; keep all air from within the body,
by cessation of breathing, and it also dies.</p>

<p>A room is heated with difficulty if the air in it does
not contain sufficient oxygen. Just so the body which
is not constantly supplied with pure air generates
very little heat. The effect of oxygen in the creation
of heat is practically demonstrated by voluntary,
rapid, deep breathing, completely filling the lungs with
air, while out in the cold. The body will become
quickly warmed on the coldest day by this practice.</p>

<p>Ten to twelve deep breaths in succession “turn on
the draught” inside and create combustion (heat),
just as opening the draught to a stove by causing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
more air to circulate within it increases combustion
or heat.</p>

<p>Remember that heat is the result of combustion—the
more rapid the combustion in the body, caused
by oxygen breathed in through the lungs, the greater
the heat.</p>

<p>Just as much heat is created when fat is burned
in the body as when it is burned outside of the body.</p>

<p>The heat from “burning” wood is produced by the
union of the oxygen from the air with hydrogen and
carbon, forming carbon dioxid and water.</p>

<p>The light in the burning of wood is caused by the
rapid combustion. Combustion occurs within the
body more slowly, hence no light is produced.</p>

<p>The exact process by which the potential energy
latent in food is converted into heat and energy is
not known. It is partly released during the digestive
process, through the chemical action produced when
the elements of the food come into contact with oxygen
and with the digestive juices. This combustion
gives to the digestive organs the necessary warmth
to enable them to do effective work. A certain
amount of heat is necessary for the chemical changes,
and digestive juices flow more freely when the body
is warm. Heat is necessary, also, to aid the peristaltic
movements of the digestive organs.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that about one-sixth of the
heat liberated evaporates through the skin, the lungs,
and the excreta, while five-sixths is required to maintain
the body heat.</p>

<p>If the digestive forces are not working perfectly
and if the food is not properly prepared, some of the
fuel is not utilized. But, in normal conditions, if
the food is supplied in proportion to the energy required,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the heat and energy given off should exactly
equal the latent heat and energy consumed. If more
food is taken than is necessary to produce heat and
energy, the excess of material is stored and if the
excess continues the bodily machinery may be clogged.
The relief lies in consuming the excess through exercise.
More oxygen is required to put the excess in
condition for use, and the extra amount of oxygen
is gained by means of the deep breathing occasioned
by exercise.</p>

<p>It is to be noted, also, that no force within the body
is lost. In the very process of the removal of waste,
heat and energy are created, so that the parts no
longer needed are utilized by the system, while they
are being removed from it. Here is a lesson in
economy of force.</p>

<p>A small portion of the heat of the body is gained
from the sun or from artificial heat, but by far the
greater part is generated within the body.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the fuel for the body consists
of <em>fats, starches, and sugars</em>, which, in combination
with oxygen, create force.</p>

<p>From the foregoing, it follows that the fuel value
of any food depends on the amount of fats, starches,
and sugars it contains.</p>

<p>The chemical combination of oxygen with food
elements and with the body tissue is known as <em>oxidation</em>.
It is this chemical action of the oxygen on the
food and on the tissues which produces heat and
energy, either in muscle, gland, or nerve. This energy,
in the muscle, expresses itself in movement; in the
gland, in chemical action, and in the nervous system,
by activity of brain or nerve centers. The nervous
energy is closely allied to electrical force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Nature provides for a reserve of heat and energy,
above the immediate needs, by storing a supply of
heat-producing material which is utilized whenever
the daily supply is insufficient or is lacking. Many
hibernating animals store up sufficient fat in summer
to provide heat for the entire winter. This fat would
not last throughout the winter, however, were the
animal active. Many individuals carry sufficient
fat to supply all of their needs for months, even
though all fat-building elements were omitted from
the diet.</p>

<p>The fact that more oxygen is required for combustion
of fat than of starches and sugars is important
for those who wish to call on the fats stored within
the body for daily heat and energy and thus reduce in
weight.</p>

<p>If sufficient starches, sugars, and fats are not consumed
in the body to supply the daily heat and energy
released by exercise, the body calls on the reserve
store in the tissues. If much fat or carbohydrates
are consumed in the daily food this will be oxidized
before the fat stored in the muscular tissue is called on.</p>

<p>The scientific reduction of weight, therefore, lies
in the regulation of the daily consumption of starches,
sugars, and fats, and the oxidation of more of these
substances through an increase in the daily exercise.</p>

<p>Deep breathing of pure air should accompany all
exercises to supply sufficient oxygen for combustion
or oxidation.</p>

<p>In warm weather little fat is needed for fuel, and
Nature provides fresh green vegetables to replace
the root vegetables of the cold weather, which, consisting
largely of starches and sugars, are readily
converted into heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>In cold weather, especially in high altitudes or
latitudes, more fuel foods are required to keep the
body warm and more fat is eaten.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that anything which creates
a greater activity of the tissues, such as muscular
exercise, liberates a greater amount of heat. The
reverse is also true. A decrease in the amount of
muscular movement means a decrease in the liberation
of heat. During exercise, a large amount of
carbohydrates and fats are released by the movements
and oxidized; the liberated heat is carried to
all parts of the system and the temperature is raised.</p>

<p>Food in the alimentary canal causes an activity
in the glands of the digestive organs maintaining
their temperature.</p>

<p>Of course, while digestion and muscular activity
are at their height, the body temperature is highest.
The temperature, as a rule, decreases from about six
at night until four or five in the morning, when it is
usually at its ebb. This is a point of importance. A
degree or two of increase in temperature, above
normal, if recorded about six at night, is not, in most
conditions, considered alarming by the physician.</p>

<p>Anything which causes an increase in heat radiation,
as perspiration, lowers the temperature, and the open
pores of the skin are valuable aids in equalizing the
body heat. A person who perspires freely does not
suffer with heat during excessive exercise, as does one
whose pores are closed.</p>

<p>Diuretic foods and beverages, such as water and
fruits (melons, lemons, oranges, grapefruit, etc.),
which increase the activity of the skin and the kidneys,
also tend to lower the body temperature.</p>

<p>One ready means of regulating the body heat is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
<em>bath</em>. If one takes a hot bath, the temperature is
materially raised by the artificial heat, but there is a
recompense in the increase of heat radiation from
the skin and the reaction is cooling. If one takes
a cold bath, the immediate effect is cooling, but the
activity set up within, to create a reaction, soon
heats the body to a greater degree than before the
bath.</p>

<p>The best way to increase the evaporation and thus
decrease the temperature of the body is by a tepid
shower or a tepid sponge. The tepid water will not
create a strong reaction, and it will cause a decrease
in temperature. Thus, for fever patients or on a
warm day, the tepid shower or sponge is commended;
for a cold day, or for the individual whose circulation
is sluggish, the cold bath, followed by friction, is
desirable. When the vitality is low, so that reaction
is slow or chilly feelings persist, the bath must be
tempered and greater friction used.</p>

<p>The generation of heat is also increased by solid
foods that require more than normal activity on the
part of the digestive organs. For this reason the
food given fever patients should be that most easily
digested and should be reduced in quantity. Liquid
or semiliquid foods are best.</p>

<p>While the elements of the food are being oxidized,
the latent (potential) energy released by the oxygen
creates mental and physical force and keeps active
the metabolic changing of food into tissues and cells,
also the changing of cells and tissues into waste.</p>

<p>Scientists have measured the energy latent in food
material, also the amount of heat given off in the
oxidation of a given quantity of waste. The unit
of measurement is the <em>calorie</em>—the amount of heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
which will raise one pound of water 4 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>The fuel value of any food denotes the total number
of calories which may be derived from a pound of that
food if it be completely oxidized in the body.</p>

<p>C. F. Langworthy gives the fuel value of proteins,
fats, and carbohydrates as follows:</p>
<br>

<table class="autotable fs90">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">1 pound of protein yields</td>
<td class="tdl"><span style="padding-left: 1em">1860</span> calories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">1 <span style="padding-left: 1em">”</span> <span style="padding-left: 1em">”</span> <span style="padding-left: .5em">fats</span> <span style="padding-left: 2em">”</span></td>
<td class="tdl"><span style="padding-left: 1em">4220</span> <span style="padding-left: 1em">”</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">1 <span style="padding-left: 1em">”</span> <span style="padding-left: 1em">”</span> <span style="padding-left: .5em">carbohydrates</span> yields</td>
<td class="tdl"><span style="padding-left: 1em">1860</span> <span style="padding-left: 1em">”</span></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

<p>That is, according to fuel value—the capacity of
the nutrients for yielding heat and mechanical power—a
pound of the protein of lean meat or egg albumen
just about equals a pound of starch or sugar, and
about two pounds of these would about equal a pound
of the fat of meat or of the body fat.</p>

<p>The calculation has been made, based on experiments,
that one who does no muscular work needs
only an amount of food which will produce 2700 calories.
One doing light muscular work needs 3000
calories. An individual doing moderately heavy
work should take 3500 calories, while heavy muscular
work takes 4500 calories.</p>

<p>One hundred grams of protein food, however, gives
only fifteen per cent. of the amount of energy required.
About 500 grams of carbohydrate and 50
grams of fat are needed to make up the 3000 calories
which must be furnished by the daily supply of food
for one doing light muscular work.</p>

<p>The brain worker, who is using brain tissue more
rapidly than the day laborer, should have a diet
equally as rich in protein, though less fat and carbohydrates
are needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>It has been estimated that an ordinary man on full
diet excretes about twenty grams (about five-eighths
of an ounce) of nitrogen a day. As protein material
contains about sixteen per cent. of nitrogen, such an
individual needs to take about 120 grams of protein
a day to supply the nitrogen needs of the body. Because
of its need for protein, the body does not store it.</p>

<p>A day laborer needs 0.28 of a pound of protein a
day with enough fat and carbohydrate to give a fuel
value of 3500 calories. A professional man requires
0.25 (<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>) of a pound of protein a day. Much more
than this is usually taken. This means from <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> to
<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> a pound of lean meat.</p>

<p><em>Nothing is lost in Nature’s distribution of force and
energy. Everything accomplished in life, either in the
physical handling of material, the brain work in planning
the constructions, the mental movements of thought
in art, literature, or science, are all representatives of
the heat and energy released from the body, and every
man and woman should endeavor to make the body yield
as large an income as possible in the expression of this
energy. In order that it may do so, it must be used with
intelligence, just as any other great machine must be
used intelligently; it must be fed, exercised, and rested
judiciously.</em></p>

<span class="fs80">REPAIR AND ELIMINATION OF WASTE (METABOLISM)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> work of the body never stops. If it is to be
kept in thorough working order its tissues must
be rebuilt as incessantly as they are torn down in
the process of producing heat and energy. These
chemical changes are called collectively <em>metabolism</em>.</p>

<p>They are divided into two groups: the chemical
process of building up complex substances from simple
ones is known as <em>anabolism</em>; the chemical process of
oxidizing and breaking down the complex substances
into simple ones, so that they are in a state to be
excreted, is called <em>catabolism</em>. While the process of
oxidation in catabolism is going on, heat and energy
are set free. Many of the chemical changes in the
body are catabolic in character. This work never
ceases—even in sleep.</p>

<p>It is not enough that the proper foods be furnished
the body in kind and quantity. The essential thing
is that the system be kept in condition to <em>assimilate</em>
the foods to its needs and to promptly eliminate the
waste. Few people assimilate all of the foods eaten.</p>

<p>By <em>assimilation</em> is meant the process by which foodstuffs
are made soluble and diffusible, so that they
can pass into the blood; also, the metabolic activity
by which the food is converted into cells and tissues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>Truly the body is a busy workshop. Think of the
billions on billions of cells being formed and destroyed
every instant in the liberation of heat and force! Think,
also, of the necessity of perfect circulation to bring
sufficient blood to the lungs, that it may gather the
oxygen and carry it, without pausing for rest, to
every tissue of the body! Even in sleep this stream
continues incessantly.</p>

<p>There is also a great lesson here in the law of supply
and demand. When the body is at mental or muscular
work, the potential energy liberated leaves through
muscle or brain, as energy, and is expressed in the
result of the work. When the body is at rest, energy
leaves it as heat (excepting such part as is necessary
to carry on metabolism, circulation, etc.).</p>

<p>If much muscular energy is called for, a deep, full
breath is instinctively drawn to supply the oxygen
necessary for the added force.</p>

<p>If strong mental work is required, attention should
be given to exercise and deep breathing, that the blood
may carry off the waste liberated by brain activity.
The difficulty is that in doing close mental work, the
body is too frequently bent over a desk in such a
manner as to restrict the action of the lungs; thus,
the brain worker, in order to continue strong mental
work, must often go into the open air, as he says,
“to rest his brain,” but in reality to obtain the
oxygen needed to put the waste, liberated by brain
energy, in condition to be carried away. The supply
of blood has been called on for the brain work;
the poor circulation through the body has allowed
an excess of carbon dioxid to accumulate and the
condition of the body designated as “tired” has
resulted. Until the necessary oxygen has been supplied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the brain and body are not balanced, not
“rested.”</p>

<p>In its conversion into tissue, heat, energy, and
waste, the importance of the chemical exceeds that
of the mechanical action of digestion, absorption, assimilation,
and elimination; yet the chemical changes
are aided by the mechanical.</p>

<p>Nature provides against ignorance of the amount
of supply necessary, by enabling the system to carry
off a limited amount of surplus food above the bodily
requirements. Her capacity in this regard is limited
and varies with each individual. Therefore common
sense is required in deciding for oneself the amount
of food which will aid, and not hinder Nature in her
processes.</p>

<p>Without doubt many eat more food than the system
requires, and when it is overloaded they do not take
the pains to burn up and eliminate the excess through
exercise and oxygen.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this theory of overeating has
been so long discussed that many have not eaten
sufficient food and their bodies are undernourished.
Many, also, from lack of exercise, hence lack of demand
of the body for food, have supposed this lack of appetite
to be Nature’s call “Enough”; inertia has resulted
and waste remains in the body. They have failed to
exercise sufficiently to create a demand for food. It
is thus undernourished because sufficient new building
material has not been supplied. The relief from
this condition is exercise and deep breathing so that
Nature removes the waste and calls for fresh building
material.</p>

<p>Many others, through mental and physical activity,
burn up much fuel and the result is the body does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
not store up sufficient fat for a reserve, or for beauty
and comfort. The nerves require a certain amount of
fat for their protection. People of this type should
take a more full and sometimes a more varied diet,
particularly more liquid, and should not fail in daily
exercise and deep breathing.</p>

<p>Each individual should know, approximately, the
chemical constituents and the proportion of these constituents
in normal blood, because from the elements
in the blood, the tissues are constructed. If certain
elements are lacking, the foods containing these elements
in largest proportions should be supplied until
the blood no longer shows the deficiency. This is
Nature’s method of correction. The variations in the
blood can be known only by chemical analyses and
until physicians have access to chemical laboratories
the giving of drugs cannot be a science.</p>

<p>Each meal, or each day’s food, may not contain the
amount of protein or of fuel ingredients necessary
for that day’s work and resupply, but the body is
continually storing material, and this reserve is constantly
being drawn on to provide any element which
may be lacking in that day’s supply. Thus, an excess
or a deficiency one day may be adjusted the next.
Healthful nourishment requires that the balance, as a
whole, be kept and that a deficiency or oversupply
be not continued for too long.</p>

<p>The distinct steps in anabolism and the effect of
oxygen on assimilation are discussed in the following
pages.</p>


<h3><em>DIGESTION</em></h3>

<p>Any discussion of the digestibility of foods must be
general, because food which agrees with one may disagree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
with another, and a food which disagrees with
one at a particular time may entirely agree with him
at some other time according to the condition of his
system. Therefore, before one passes on the adaptability
of a food to his system, he should know that
this food agrees or disagrees with him under various
conditions.</p>

<p>The chances are that the food is right but that the
attitude of mind and the condition of the body are
abnormal.</p>

<p>The digestibility of food depends largely on the
physical condition of the individual, because the
amount of digestive juices poured into the alimentary
canal is influenced by this condition, particularly
by the condition of the nerves. If sufficient juices,
in proper proportions, are not poured into the digestive
tract, the foodstuffs are not made soluble for
absorption.</p>

<p>Digestion is practically synonymous with solution—all
solid foods must be reduced to a liquid state by
means of the digestive juices and water before they
can pass through the walls of the stomach and intestines
and enter the blood.</p>

<p>Each individual should learn to like the foods containing
the nutrient elements which experience and
blood tests have shown to be lacking in his case.</p>

<p>Yet while it is true that in most cases the aversion
to a particular food is largely mental, there are kinds
of food which, to certain individuals, according to the
chemical composition of the body, act as actual
poisons, <em>e. g.</em>, strawberries, cheese, or coffee.</p>

<p>The question of likes and of dislikes in foods, is
largely habit, and one can learn to like almost any
food, if one really has the desire to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>When the habit has been formed of discriminating
too much in the food, of discarding this food or that,
because at some time it has disagreed, due to the
particular condition at the time, the mind approaches
the table in a pessimistic attitude and the saliva and
the gastric juices are retarded in their flow.</p>

<p>When one is exercising freely, so that the muscular
and mucous coats of the digestive system are strong,
the body will handle foods which, during sedentary
habits, it would not digest.</p>

<p><em>Much indigestion is due to mental apathy. The
mind often needs arousing to an interest in something.</em></p>

<p>Such an individual needs to know that one of the
hardest things for the members of his family is to live
day by day with one who maintains an attitude of
mental depression, and he should stir himself for
“his stomach’s sake,” as well as for the sake of his
family, to a cheerful interest in something. He
should let go his grudge and ride a hobby, if it is a
cheerful one, and ride it hard.</p>

<p>It may be well, here, to trace, briefly, the progress
of the food through the digestive tract and the action
of the juices and the ferments on it.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Salivary
Digestion</div>

<p>The food in the mouth is mixed with
saliva, which begins the dissolution of the
starches.</p>

<p>The saliva consists of about 99.5 per cent. water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
and 0.5 per cent. solids. The solids consist of ptyalin,
sodium chlorid, sodium carbonate, mucus, and epithelium.
Ptyalin, the most important of these, is
the active digestive agent; the mucus lubricates the
masticated food; the sodium carbonate insures the alkalinity
of the food, and the water dissolves the food
that the juices may more readily reach and act on
each particle.</p>

<p>The starches are the only foods whose chemical
digestion is begun in the mouth. They are first
broken up by the ptyalin into dextrin and then into
the more simple sugar, known as maltose.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It is important that sufficient saliva be mixed with
the food through mastication, because unless the
digestion of the starches is begun by the saliva, either
in the mouth or after it is swallowed, they are not
acted on until they reach the small intestine, consequently
their digestion is unduly delayed. The
pancreatic juice must then do more than its normal
work of digestion.</p>

<p>The saliva flows into the mouth, more or less, at
all times, but more copiously during mastication.</p>

<p>The movement of the jaws in chewing incites its
flow and when starches are not well digested, gum
chewing, in moderation, though not a refined habit,
is beneficial.</p>

<p>The evident purpose of the saliva when food is not
present is to keep the lining of the mouth moist.</p>

<p>Salivary digestion is carried on in the stomach until
the food becomes thoroughly mixed with the gastric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
juice, which, being acid, inhibits the action of the
ptyalin.</p>

<p>The thorough and regular cleansing of the teeth
is an important aid to digestion. Food products
allowed to remain about the teeth ferment, rendering
the mouth acid. When the mouth is acid, the alkaline
saliva does not secrete in sufficient amount and
the mouth is more or less dry.</p>

<p>The mouth is acid in rheumatism and allied conditions
and the saliva may be thick and ropy so that it
does not moisten the food properly. On the other
hand the flow of saliva may be too free, the ptyalin
is then too much diluted to promptly act on the food.
This may result from overstimulation of the salivary
glands occasioned by the excessive chewing of gum, or
tobacco. These excesses also carry too much air into
the stomach, resulting in flatulence.</p>

<p>The flow of saliva is controlled, largely, by nerves
centering in the medulla oblongata. The sight of
food, pleasingly served, or even the thought of food
which one likes, will increase the flow. This is one
instance of the control of thought over digestion, and
the importance of forming the habit of cultivating
a taste for all kinds of food is apparent. The stronger
the relish for the food, and the more thoroughly it is
masticated and mixed with the saliva, the more
perfectly will the first step in digestion be accomplished.</p>

<p>Thorough mastication is important, not only because
the chemical action on the starch molecules is
facilitated by the softening and mixing with the saliva,
but also because thorough mastication tends to prevent
overeating—the appetite is more quickly satisfied
when the food is well masticated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>Cool water encourages the flow of saliva and for
this reason should be drunk before meals, particularly
when digestion is weak. It may be taken at
rest periods during the meal. (See page <a href="#Page_31">31</a>.)</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">The Mouth
and Nasal
Passages</div>

<p>The relation of the mouth and nasal
passages to the digestive processes is seldom
considered by the average individual.
Their importance to the growing child is
being recognized by the examination of school children
which is now being made a part of the health program
in many of our cities. Their importance to the adult
is no less.</p>

<p>Food particles allowed to remain around the teeth,
or in the cavities of decayed teeth, incite bacterial
action. With the next meal these bacteria are swallowed
and cause fermentation of the food, occasioning
indigestion, and possibly, dyspepsia.</p>

<p>Decayed or missing teeth, swollen gums, or pyorrhea,
interfere with proper mastication of food, hence
it does not receive the thorough salivary moistening
necessary; the starches pass practically unchanged
into the stomach and small intestine, overburdening
these organs.</p>

<p>Catarrh of the nasal passages, with the constant
swallowing of germ-filled secretions, carries morbid
products into the stomach, coating the glands with
mucus, often infecting them; it may also occasion a
catarrhal condition of that organ.</p>

<p>If, from any cause, the saliva becomes acid, dryness
of the mouth results and desire for food is lessened or
absent. Diseases of the salivary glands may render
these necessary secretions unfit to perform their work.</p>

<p>In illness the mouth often drops open from weakness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
producing the same condition of dryness. The
mouth, in illness, is too often neglected by those in
charge of the invalid.</p>

<p>Adenoids and enlarged turbinates in child or adult,
narrowing the nasal passages and preventing the
ingress of air, cause mouth breathing. The air dries
the membranes and the tongue becomes swollen and
cracks, interfering with proper mastication.</p>

<p>Adenoids should be removed, and any other condition
which interferes with the proper function of the
mouth should be remedied as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The mouth should be properly cleansed, the gums
massaged, the teeth thoroughly brushed, back as well
as front, defective teeth repaired or removed, abnormal
growths eliminated, and the secretions kept
abundant and healthy. Food well prepared in the
mouth by thorough mastication satisfies hunger,
renders more easy the work of the stomach and intestines,
and aids in the general welfare of the system.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Gum-chewing</div>

<p>This too prevalent habit may aggravate
the condition which it is supposed to cure.
A slight indigestion appearing, gum is
often chewed to cause a fuller flow of saliva to aid
digestion. If gum-chewing is indulged in to excess,
however, the muscular movements overstimulate the
salivary glands, eventually weakening them. Overuse
of the chewing muscles and overexcitation of the
nerves fatigue them and cause them to weaken. The
sticky gum, adhering to fillings in the teeth, loosens
them and furnishes a lodging place for food particles
and bacteria.</p>

<p>The excess of saliva may render the gastric juice
alkaline, inhibiting its action. Excess of air swallowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
with the saliva may cause flatulence or accumulation
of gas in the stomach.</p>

<p>Lack of poise and nerve tension is increased by
excessive gum-chewing, resulting in fatigue of the
entire body. This lack of poise may be noted in any
public assembly, as the “movies,” frequented by
gum-chewers.</p>

<p>The habit, as generally practiced, is not an inspiring
sight and should be discouraged.</p>

<p>Gum-chewing in moderation, for a few minutes
after a meal, may not do harm, but its indiscriminate
use is to be deplored. Thorough mastication
of food will serve to supply the necessary
saliva.</p>

<p>Exercise directed to the stomach and a more thorough
circulation and elimination will do more for any
digestive derangement than the excessive practice of
chewing gum.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Stomach
Digestion</div>

<p>As the food enters the stomach, the
gastric juice pours out from the mucous
lining, very much as the saliva pours into
the mouth. Like the saliva, it consists of 99.5 per
cent. water and 0.5 per cent. solids. The solids of
the gastric juice are pepsin, rennin, hydrochloric acid,
and mucus.</p>

<p>The <em>mucus</em> serves to lubricate the food as in the
saliva. It perhaps also aids to prevent the digestion
of the mucous lining of the stomach.</p>

<p>The <em>hydrochloric acid</em> and the <em>pepsin</em> cause the
principal chemical changes in the food while in the
stomach. They act only on the proteins. The
hydrochloric acid must be present before the pepsin
can act, as only in an acid medium can pepsin dissolve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
the proteins. It is also of an antiseptic nature and
hinders or prevents the decomposition of food.</p>

<p>The <em>rennin</em> ferment precipitates the casein.</p>

<p>The only digestion of starches in the stomach is
that continued by the saliva.</p>

<p>Gastric juice begins to flow into the stomach soon
after eating, but normally it is not secreted in sufficient
quantity to supersede salivary digestion for from
twenty to forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>The result of gastric digestion of proteins is their
conversion, first, into albumin, then into proteoses,
and, lastly, into peptone, which is protein in a more
simple, soluble, and diffusible form. In the form of
peptone, the proteins are in condition to be absorbed.</p>

<p>If the food has been properly cooked and masticated,
gastric digestion will be completed in from one
and one-half to three hours. If not properly cooked
and masticated, the stomach digestion may continue
from one to two hours longer. It should, however,
be completed in three hours.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the evening meal is ordinarily
digested before sleep, as one does not retire for from
three to five hours after eating.</p>

<p>If, through imperfect mastication, or a disordered
condition of the stomach, the digestion is not completed
in about three hours, the food is likely to be
retained in the stomach and by its weight may cause
prolapsus of that organ if the supporting tissues are
weak. Fermentation may ensue and give rise to
gases which may cause acute distress.</p>

<p>Animal foods, which are readily digested, remain
in the stomach for a shorter time. Meat, as a rule,
is easily digested, because the digestive juices of the
animal have converted the starches and sugars. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
white meat of chicken is digested in a shorter time
than the red or the dark meat.</p>

<p>Corn, beets, peas, beans, etc., take about three and
a half hours to digest; baked potatoes about two and
a half hours.</p>

<p>Raw vegetables and fruits remain about the same
length of time as potatoes.</p>

<p>Sugar is usually absorbed within an hour.</p>

<p>The cereals, if well cooked, take but two hours.</p>

<p>Coarse or badly masticated food, tough meats,
unripe fruits, and much fat hinder digestion.</p>

<p>Undigested food passing into the intestine may fail
to be acted on there and will sometimes produce
diarrhea.</p>

<p>Fluids leave the stomach more rapidly than solids.
Seven ounces of water entirely leaves the stomach in
one and one-half hours, seven ounces of boiled milk
in about two hours. Water and buttermilk almost
immediately begin to pass out of the stomach; milk
begins to pass out in about fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>The flow of gastric juice, as the flow of saliva, is
governed by the nerves; the sight, taste, and smell
of food, and the attitude of mind toward it, to a certain
extent, regulate its flow.</p>

<p>After the food has accumulated, during the progress
of a meal, the stomach begins a series of wave-like
movements called peristaltic waves.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> These waves
propel the food through the length of the stomach
towards its lower opening, known as the pyloric
orifice. During this process the food is thoroughly
mixed with the gastric juice.</p>

<p>During the early stages of digestion of solids, the
sphincter muscles of the pylorus keep the lower opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
of the stomach closed, but, as digestion progresses,
the pylorus gradually relaxes to let the digested,
soluble portion of the food pass into the intestine.
If the food still remains in a solid form, by reason of
being improperly cooked or poorly masticated, as it
touches the pylorus, these sphincter muscles, almost
as if they were endowed with reasoning faculties,
close, forcing the undigested mass back to be further
acted on by the gastric juice—the solid mass is not
allowed to pass until dissolved.</p>

<p>If the individual abuses the stomach and causes it
to work overtime, it becomes exhausted and demands
rest; it refuses to discharge the gastric juice in proper
proportion; the peristaltic movements are weak; and
food is not promptly or forcefully moved along the
stomach and mixed with the gastric juice. This
condition is termed indigestion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Intestinal
Digestion</div>

<p>The food passes from the stomach,
through the pylorus into the small intestine.
In this condition of partial digestion it is
called chyme.</p>

<p>The first twelve inches of the small intestine is
known as the duodenum. In the duodenum the
food is acted on by the pancreatic juice, the bile, and
the intestinal juices. These juices act on proteins,
fats, and carbohydrates. The bile acts on the fats,
while the pancreatic and intestinal juices act on the
proteins and the carbohydrates. The starches, or
dextrin, not fully digested by the saliva, are changed
to maltose and glucose, while the trypsin from the
pancreatic juice, together with the intestinal juices,
change into peptone the protein not fully digested in
the stomach. The pancreatic juice also digests the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
starch found in raw fruits and in such raw vegetables
as radishes and lettuce.</p>

<p>Fats are almost entirely digested in the small intestine.
The presence of fat stimulates the flow of
pancreatic juice, which, in turn, stimulates the flow
of bile. For this reason, in some conditions, if the
liver is sluggish, fatty foods in moderation are desirable.
When bile is not present in sufficient amount
the fatty foods ferment and cause gases and foul
odors.</p>

<p>The fats are absorbed almost entirely in the small
intestine—mostly in the duodenum. Some of the
fat may be absorbed directly without undergoing the
process of emulsification. Some oils, as paraffin oil,
are not absorbed at all but act only as a lubricant of
the intestines.</p>

<p>When the food enters the intestine its reaction is
acid. Mixed with the bile, pancreatic and intestinal
juices, which are alkaline, its reaction becomes alkaline.</p>

<p>The pancreatic juice splits up the fats into glycerin
and fatty acids and enables the bile to exert its important
emulsifying power. The bile markedly aids
this action of the pancreatic juice though it has no
fat-splitting power in itself.</p>

<p>Steapsin, another ferment of the pancreatic juice,
acts on both fats and carbohydrates in either an acid
or alkaline medium.</p>

<p>The sodium in the bile unites with the fatty acid,
forming a soap which coats the tiny particles of fat
and emulsifies them. The bile thus aids in the absorption
of the fats. It also lubricates the intestinal mass,
facilitating its passage through the entire length of
the intestines. Thus it is a very potent agent in
regulating the bowel movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>A diminution in the flow of bile quickly expresses
itself in constipation.</p>

<p>Fat and protein stimulate the activity of the liver,
while starches, if taken in excess, incline to overload it.</p>

<p>The food is forced along the intestinal tract by
peristaltic or muscular relaxation and contraction
waves, as in the stomach. As it is so forced, the
nutrient elements, after being put into condition for
absorption, are taken up through the villi of the intestinal
walls by the portal veins and the lacteals of the
submucous lining.</p>

<p>A larger proportion of food is digested and absorbed
than was formerly supposed, and the excretions from
the intestines are, in many cases, made up almost
entirely of refuse, and of the catabolic waste of the
system. In an ordinary mixed diet, it is stated that
about ninety-two per cent. of the proteins, ninety-five
per cent. of the fats, and ninety-seven per cent. of the
carbohydrates are retained by the body.</p>

<p><em>In digestion, it is of the utmost importance that the
muscular, mucous, and submucous coats, and the secreting
glands of the stomach and intestines be kept thoroughly
strong and active, that the digestive juices may be freely
poured out, the nutriment be freely absorbed, and the
food be moved along the digestive tract. The strength of
any organ is gained through the nutriment in the blood;
therefore, daily exercise, which calls the blood freely to these
organs is imperative. Daily exercise should be directed
to the vital organs. A walk for exercise is not sufficient.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote">Absorption
of Food</div>

<p>The greater part of the food is absorbed
through the intestines, yet some proteins
which have been fully digested by the
gastric juice, and certain fats, particularly the fats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
in milk, which are in a natural state of emulsion, may
be absorbed through the walls of the stomach. However,
the absorption
through the stomach is
small compared to that
through the small intestine.</p>

</figure>

<p>The small intestine is
peculiarly fitted for absorption.
Its mucous
lining is thrown up into
folds to furnish a larger
surface for this purpose.
The folds hold the food
as it passes toward the
large intestine, until the
villi have the opportunity
to absorb it.</p>

<p>These transverse folds
of the intestinal walls
are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">valvulæ conniventes</i>.</p>

<p>The villi are tiny finger-like
projections of the mucous lining of the intestines,
which stand out of the lining somewhat as the
nap on plush. They have been called “sucking” villi,
because during the movements of the intestines they
seem to suck in the liquid food.</p>

<p>As soon as the foodstuffs—proteins, carbohydrates,
and fats—are put in an absorbable state called
chyle, they are very promptly taken up by the
villi.</p>

<p>If for any reason the chyle remains unabsorbed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
it is liable to be attacked by the bacteria always
present in the intestines, and gases form.</p>

<p>The peptones, sugars, and saponified fats are rapidly
absorbed, while the undigested portion, together with
the unabsorbed water, the bile, mucus, and bacterial
products, are passed through the ileocecal valve into
the large intestine.</p>

<p>The mass passes up the ascending colon, on the
right side of the abdomen, across the transverse, and
down the descending colon, on the left side, losing,
by absorption, the small amount of foodstuffs not
absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. That
the large intestine is to some extent adapted to absorption
is shown by clinical experiments with patients
who cannot retain food in the stomach, the food in
such cases being given through rectal injections.</p>

<p>While water and salt are absorbed in both the stomach
and small intestine, the larger part of the water
passes into the large intestine, that it may assist the
passage of the intestinal contents.</p>

<p>Water also stimulates peristaltic movements.</p>

<p>As the food is absorbed through the walls of the
alimentary canal, it is picked up by the rootlets of
the mesenteric veins and by the lymph channels—the
latter through the abdominal cavity are called
lacteals. Nearly all of the fats are absorbed through
the lacteals. The whitish color given to the contents
of the lacteals, by the saponified fats, gives rise to
the term “lacteal.”</p>

<p>Nearly all of the proteins and sugars pass through
the mesenteric veins and the portal veins to the liver.
Here the sugars are at once attacked by the liver
cells and built up into glycogen as described on pages
151 and 159. A small portion of the proteins, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
do not go to the liver, but are passed directly
into the lymphatics and thus into the blood stream,
where they are again carried to the liver, and the urea
is separated.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To sum up, the larger part of the sugars, starches,
proteins, and fats is absorbed through the small intestine,
a small amount being absorbed in the stomach and
a very little through the large intestine. While some
water and salts are absorbed in the stomach and small
intestine, these are largely absorbed in the large
intestine.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Economy
in Food</div>

<p>It is economy to keep the digestive
organs and the circulation and tissues
strong, in order that all foods eaten may
yield returns, instead of hampering the activity of
the body.</p>

<p>The food which furnishes the most tissue-building
substance and yields the most heat and energy, with
the least refuse, is the economical food, provided it is
varied enough to meet the psychical needs as well as
the physical.</p>

<p>Whether or not a food is economical depends on
the degree to which it stimulates the activity of
the mind as well as the body. Preparation and
serving here are as important as the material to be
served.</p>

<p>Economy in food is a question into which many
factors should enter. A cheap food is not always an
economical food. Amount and keeping qualities,
palatability, ripeness or unripeness, the age, habit,
and occupation of the partakers, all have their share
in the problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>In the selection of food for any individual, the
result to be gained from the food must be borne in
mind. If one is doing heavy muscular work, more
protein to rebuild tissue, as well as more carbohydrates
and fats to produce energy, are required than
if one’s habits of work are sedentary.</p>

<p>In mental work, in which the brain is continually
active, proteins are required to resupply the brain
tissue, but the fats and carbohydrates may be lessened.
If the brain is sufficiently active to use all of the fuel
in brain energy one does not accumulate fat.</p>

<p>In sedentary occupations, which do not call for
hard and continuous mental activity, the carbohydrates
and fats, if taken in excess, are stored within
the system, clogging it and producing torpid liver,
constipation, and obesity.</p>

<p>In a study of tables of food values, in making up a
dietary, the question should be to provide the largest
quantity of nutriment at the lowest cost, with due
attention to palatability and variety.</p>

<p>In the selection of meats, for instance, while beef
steak may cost twice as much as beef stew, it must be
borne in mind that beefsteak contains very little
waste, and that it contains a large proportion of albuminoids,
or the tissue-building proteins, while, in beef
stew, bone and connective tissue predominate. A
large proportion of the proteins obtained from the
beef stew are gelatinoids and extractives—not the
tissue-building albuminoids. (See page <a href="#Page_56">56</a>.)</p>

<p>In comparing the cheaper and the more expensive
cuts in the same kind of beefsteak, however, the
cheaper cuts often yield quite as much nutriment as
the more expensive ones. Round steak is just as
nourishing as porterhouse and cheaper, if one considers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the greater number of helpings derived from a pound
of round steak than from a pound of porterhouse.</p>

<p>For the aged or the invalid, however, the question
of preparation will determine the relative economy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs80">ORGANS AND CONDITIONS AFFECTING DIGESTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> purpose of this chapter is to show the work
of other than the digestive organs in assimilation,
construction, and elimination.</p>

<p>The <em>liver</em> is commonly called the chemical workshop
of the body. The digested food is carried by the
blood (portal veins) to the liver as soon as it is
absorbed from the alimentary canal. As the food
materials filter through the blood capillaries, between
the liver cells, several substances are absorbed, particularly
sugar, which is changed into the animal
starch called <em>glycogen</em>. It is held in the liver for a
few hours in this form and is then redigested and
gradually given to the blood in the form of sugar.</p>

<p>While the conversion of the sugar is one prominent
function of the liver, it also acts on the proteins—not
as they are first passed through the liver in the
blood, but as they are returned to the liver from the
muscle tissue, partly oxidized and broken up into
simpler products. The liver cells absorb and further
oxidize and combine them into nitrogenous waste,
which the kidneys throw off in urea.</p>

<p>The liver and the spleen also dissolve the pigment
or coloring matter out of the red blood corpuscles.
As these become useless, they are broken up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
liver and the spleen. The iron is retained by the
liver cells and the remainder is thrown off in the bile.</p>

<p>The liver is on guard for all poisons which pass
through it in the blood. The large part of these
toxic substances are absorbed through the alimentary
canal with the foodstuffs. Many of them are the
result of the fermentation of foods which are not
digested so promptly or so thoroughly as they should
be, on account of an insufficient secretion of digestive
juices, or on account of a failure to secrete them in
normal proportions, due to inactivity of the stomach
and intestines.</p>

<p>Nature thus supplies a guard to oxidize, or break
down these poisons and make them harmless, so
that normally they do not affect the nerves and the
blood stream, and, through these, the entire system.</p>

<p>The necessity of correct habits of deep breathing
will be readily seen here, because oxygen is required
to break down the poisons as well as to oxidize the
worn-out tissues.</p>

<p>One example of the action of the liver in rendering
substances harmless, is its oxidation of <em>alcohol</em>. From
one to three ounces of alcohol a day may be oxidized
and made harmless in the liver, varying according to
the individual and to the condition, at different
times, in the same person. If the limit of one to
three ounces is exceeded, the excess is not oxidized
and intoxication results. This is the reason one may
become intoxicated at one time when the same amount
of liquor would not appreciably affect one at another.</p>

<p>The <em>muscles</em> play an important part in the use of
foods. Most of the heat is generated in them by the
action of the oxygen in the blood upon the sugar
and fats, liberating their latent heat. This heat is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
liberated during every moment of the twenty-four
hours whether one is asleep or awake. Of course,
more is liberated during exercise, since the movement
of the muscles sets all tissues into activity and the
blood circulates more strongly, bringing a greater
supply of oxygen to them.</p>

<p>It is always well during active exercise to stop frequently
and fully inflate the <em>lungs</em>, not only to bring
more oxygen to the blood, but to change the residual
air and in the inflation to exercise the lung tissue more
freely, bringing a better supply of nourishment to it.
We forget that the lung tissue as well as every other
tissue of the body needs exercise and a full supply of
nourishment.</p>

<p>One should form the habit of breathing fully and
deeply—otherwise the liberated carbon dioxid will
cause an increased pressure throughout the blood
stream, particularly about the heart and in the head.
This pressure is relieved when the excess of carbon
dioxid has been thrown off by the lungs. Much dull
headache is due to the retention of carbon dioxid
resulting from shallow breathing.</p>

<p>Nature makes the effort to throw off this excess of
carbon dioxid by forcing one to breathe more rapidly
while running or taking unusual exercise.</p>

<p>A certain amount of protein is constantly oxidized
in muscular action also, being broken down into carbon
dioxid, water, and a number of nitrogenous mid-products.
The carbon dioxid and water are thrown
off by the lungs, and the partially oxidized nitrogenous
waste is carried to the liver, where it is further
oxidized and prepared for excretion through the kidneys,
lungs, skin, and intestines.</p>

<p>Through their stimulant action, the <em>nerves</em> aid in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
oxidizing food materials. During periods of rest,
food materials are also stored in the nerve cells.
During nervous activity they are oxidized and carried
away through the blood and the lymph. This oxidation
of the food, stored in the nerves, creates nervous
energy and heat.</p>

<p>The energy liberated by the nerves resembles
electrical energy.</p>

<p>When one is continuously using an excess of nerve
activity, all reserve food material, stored in the nerve
cells, is used and the nerves become undernourished.
The result is seen in neurasthenic conditions of various
kinds.</p>

<p>The nerves as well as other tissues require protein
to renew their substance as well as fats and carbohydrates
for their energy.</p>

<p>The vasomotor nerves influence digestion to a
marked extent by regulating the blood pressure in the
digestive organs and the consequent rate of speed with
which digestion and absorption take place. They
speed up or slow down the movements of the alimentary
canal, thus aiding and preventing the admixture
of the food with the digestive juices. By acting on
the glands, they aid or prevent the secretions from
being formed and poured out. They thus materially
affect digestion.</p>

<p>The vasomotor nerve centers are in the medulla
oblongata.</p>

<p>The <em>lungs</em> absorb oxygen and eliminate carbon
dioxid. They occasionally throw off a very little
organic material.</p>

<p>The carbon dioxid is carried to the lungs from the
tissues through the venous stream and diffused
through the walls of capillaries in the lungs. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
oxygen is absorbed in the thin air sacs in the capillary
walls.</p>

<p>If the lungs are cramped by a faulty position of the
body, by excess of fat, or by tight clothing, they cannot
expand to their fullest extent. The blood is thus
imperfectly aërated and oxygenized and is not freed
of its waste. The lung tissue is imperfectly exercised,
sufficient blood not being brought to the lung cells
to insure their strength.</p>

<p>The cramping of the lungs is due largely to incorrect
habits of standing and sitting.</p>

<p>The <em>kidneys</em> do not absorb as do the lungs, neither
do they perform any anabolic work as does the liver,
nor catabolic work as the muscles, nerves, and the
liver. They simply throw off waste matter.</p>

<p>As the blood passes through them urea, uric acid,
urates, sulphates, and sodium phosphates pass from
it and with the water are thrown from the system;
hence the kidneys are purifying organs, as are the
lungs. The blood returning from the kidneys through
the veins is pure, just as the blood in the pulmonary
vein is pure, while that in the arteries to the kidneys
is impure.</p>

<p>Interference with the action of the kidneys results
in an excess of these substances in the blood and may
produce a condition of intoxication known as uremic
poisoning.</p>

<p>The <em>skin</em>, by pressure on the capillaries, controls,
to some extent, their dilatation, and thus prevents
an excessive loss of fluid. When a portion of the
skin is removed by accident, as after burns, drops of
moisture may be seen gathering on the denuded surface
and may result in considerable loss if the denuded
surface is large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>The skin is a protective covering. We are constantly
surrounded with bacteria, dirt, etc., and the
skin prevents their absorption.</p>

<p>It contains glands which secrete a fluid fat. This
keeps the skin soft and flexible, preventing it from
becoming too dry. The skin also prevents the underlying
tissues from injury through abrasions or contact
with foreign substances, as in various industries.</p>

<p>It also contains sweat glands, which throw off
body waste in the form of salts and moisture in the
perspiration; this helps to regulate the body heat and
to aid in keeping the skin soft.</p>

<p>The kidneys and the skin are interdependent; if
the kidneys are inactive the skin must throw off a
larger quantity of waste and if the skin is inactive, or
if for any reason its pores are closed, the kidneys
become more active.</p>

<p>The skin also throws off carbon dioxid and, to a
slight extent, it absorbs oxygen.</p>

<p>Besides digesting and absorbing food, the <em>intestines</em>
eliminate waste.</p>

<p>In their work of elimination, they pass off all undigested
matter. They also carry off bile pigment,
bile salts, mucus, other decomposition products—also
a little unabsorbed fat.</p>

<p>Coarse articles of food containing fibers which do
not digest, such as the bran of grains and the coarser
fibers of fruits and vegetables (much of their substances
are not food in the strictest sense), are valuable,
as they increase the peristaltic movements of
the intestines and assist in carrying the waste excretions
along their course.</p>

<p>The intestines also carry off the organic refuse
which is produced by the chemical action of oxygen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
This refuse consists of carbon dioxid and the
nitrogenous waste.</p>

<p>Combustion, or burning of fuel in any form (oxidation
to release latent heat and energy), always leaves
a residue, and it is the work of the intestines to eliminate
much of this refuse. When coal is burned, gas,
smoke, ashes, and cinders constitute the waste; if
these were not allowed to escape or were not removed
from a stove the fire would soon go out—the smoke
and gas would smother it and the accumulation of
ashes would prevent the circulation of oxygen.</p>

<p>This is true in the body—the carbon dioxid not
being allowed to pass off would soon put out the fires
of life; it would poison the body and inhibit the action
of the nerves. If the waste is not thrown from the
system we notice it in a feeling of lassitude, both
mental and physical. If the nitrogenous waste (like
ashes and cinders) is not eliminated, one will die in
convulsions in a few days.</p>

<p>The absolute necessity of a free elimination of waste
will be readily seen. If the engine is to do its work,
the engineer sees that it is kept perfectly clean—otherwise
it becomes clogged, works inefficiently, and
soon wears out. The same is true in the body—clogging
in any part overworks and wears out other
parts dependent on the work of the defective one.</p>

<p>Constipation, or a failure of the intestines to eliminate
the waste is a grave menace to the system.
The poisonous gases accumulating are absorbed by
the system.</p>

<p>The <em>blood</em> carries the digested food and the oxygen
to the various tissues and organs, which select from
among the nutrients offered to them the ones suited
to their growth and repair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>It is the universal medium of exchange.</p>

<p>It carries carbon dioxid to the lungs and the wastes
of the tissues to the other eliminative organs.</p>

<p>It carries impure material to the purifying organs,
and pure material away from them.</p>

<p>When it is lacking in quality or quantity the body
suffers and if the lack continues the body dies.</p>

<p>Every organ contributes its share to the work of the
blood and every organ takes from the blood some of
its elements. If the blood pressure is too low, stagnation
may occur. If it is too high an abnormal condition
of the system results.</p>

<p>In fact, on the condition of the blood depends the
effective working of the entire organism.</p>

<p>Constant effort then should be intelligently exerted
to eat the proper foods, to exercise judiciously, to
think healthful thoughts, to secure thorough elimination
of waste in order that the whole body shall be
fit for the work which its owner desires it to do.</p>


<h3><em>SUMMARY</em></h3>

<p>The processes which the food undergoes in digestion—conversion
into condition to be absorbed by
the body; in absorption through the walls of the
intestines and stomach, and the metabolic processes
which it undergoes in being converted into heat and
energy and again broken down and eliminated as
waste, are, in brief, as follows:</p>

<p><em>The Saliva</em> begins the digestion of starches and
sugars in the mouth, and continues this digestion for
a time in the stomach.</p>

<p><em>The Stomach</em>, when in normal condition, digests
the proteins. If any proteins fail of digestion in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
stomach the process is completed in the intestines.
It has little absorptive power.</p>

<p><em>The Small Intestine</em> digests and absorbs the fats
and continues the digestion of starches, sugars, fats,
and proteins, when this digestion is not completed
in the stomach.</p>

<p>The large part of the food is absorbed through the
small intestine, though a small part is absorbed
through the walls of the stomach and through the
large intestine.</p>

<p>Fats are almost entirely absorbed in the small
intestine. They are absorbed through the lacteals
and are carried into the blood-stream.</p>

<p>The intestines, aside from their work of digestion
and absorption, excrete bile pigment, bile salts, mucus,
and other decomposition products, also such food
materials as are not digested.</p>

<p><em>The Liver.</em> The proteins, the starches (converted
into maltose), and sugars pass into the liver. The
sugar (including the sugar in vegetables, milk, fruits
and that used for sweetening as well as the carbohydrates
which have been changed into maltose) is
converted into glycogen in the liver, stored for a time,
and again broken down into a condition in which it
may be absorbed into the blood.</p>

<p>The proteins pass through the liver but are not
acted on by this organ until they again return to the
liver through the blood stream, after they have been
partly oxidized in the tissues. The liver further
oxidizes them, putting them into condition to be
excreted by the kidneys and intestines.</p>

<p>The liver also breaks up the worn-out red corpuscles
putting them into condition to be eliminated in the bile.</p>

<p>It oxidizes and renders harmless poisonous substances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
absorbed in the food, such as fermented
food products and alcohol.</p>

<p>The <em>Muscles</em> oxidize the fats and sugars liberating
the latent heat and energy. They partly oxidize
proteins which are further broken up in the liver.</p>

<p>The <em>Nerves</em> oxidize food materials stored in the
nerve cells, providing nervous energy.</p>

<p>The <em>Lungs</em> absorb oxygen and throw off carbon
dioxid, watery vapor, and some organic substances.</p>

<p>The <em>Kidneys</em> and the <em>Skin</em> excrete water, carbon
dioxid, and nitrogenous waste.</p>

<p>The <em>Blood</em> carries the vital elements derived from
the food to all the organs and tissues, keeping them
alive and actively functioning. It also carries waste
products to the skin, lungs, kidneys, and intestines
for elimination.</p>


<h3><em>FACTORS INFLUENCING DIGESTION</em></h3>

<p>As before stated, it is not the food eaten, but that
which the body digests and assimilates, or appropriates
to its needs, which counts. Many factors influence
such nourishment. The principal aids are a
forceful circulation, the plentiful breathing of oxygen,
and free elimination.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">The
Appetite</div>

<p>If one has no appetite, we have been
told in the past to abstain from food until
the system calls for it, or to eat but a very
little of the lightest food at regular meal times. This
is right, but it deals with the effect and not the cause
of the lack of appetite.</p>

<p>The chances are that this lack is due to retained
waste. Whenever there is too much waste in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
system, the chances are that the digestive organs
will not call for more food, and when the appetite is
lacking the effort should be made to see that the
system is thoroughly clean. Every muscle and tissue
must be relieved of the excess of waste. The correction
of the lack of appetite, then, is not only abstinence
from food, but brisk exercise, plenty of fresh
air in the lungs, free drinking of water, and the elimination
of the waste through the intestines, skin, lungs,
and kidneys.</p>

<p>One should not be led into forming the habit of
irregular eating, however. The stomach forms habits
and the supply of food must be regular, just as the
nursing child must be fed regularly, or digestive disturbance
is sure to result.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to eat between meals nor
to eat candy or indigestible foods.</p>

<p>The lack of appetite may be due to mental preoccupation
which does not let the brain relax long
enough for the physical needs to assert themselves.
One should relax the brain in pleasant thought during
the meal.</p>

<p>But the chief thing to bear in mind is to create the
demand for food by relieving the system of its waste,
by calling for more supply to the muscles through
exercise, and by giving the system plenty of oxygen
through deep breathing.</p>

<p>The appetite is partly under control of the will
and may be trained. It is more or less capricious
and may be satisfied with little, or it may demand
large amounts of food. Grief or worry will destroy
it, as will foul air, and overfatigue.</p>

<p>A voracious appetite may be due to an irritation
of the nerves of the stomach or to a disturbance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
digestion of one kind or another. This is shown by
the fact that sometimes those with abnormal appetites
are thin and undernourished because of non-digestion
of the food. If the food is eaten slowly and
well chewed, the desire for too great an amount will
be lessened. The food will also be better digested.</p>

<p>The chalk-eating, clay-eating, salt-eating habits
are well known. The desire is largely mental and
may be treated by substituting healthful thoughts
for morbid longings, and changing the monotonous
or restricted diet for one more liberal.</p>

<p>If the appetite is lacking because of physical exhaustion,
it is unwise to eat, because the digestive organs
are tired, and to load a tired stomach with food, still
further weakens it and results in indigestion. The
better plan is to drink two glasses of cold water and
lie down for an hour.</p>

<p>Lack of appetite and the taste for highly seasoned
food may come from a monotonous diet or one that
does not contain sufficient coarse food or sufficient
water to stimulate peristalsis; the result is stagnation
and constipation, with the disorders that follow
in its train. The monotonous diet, from its effect on
the mind, results in lack of desire for food. Both the
condition and the appetite are often stimulated and
changed by a greater variety in the kinds of food.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to form the habit of using
stimulants too freely, particularly with children.</p>

<p>Condiments and stimulants, used to make the food
“appetizing,” unduly stimulate the nerves, and pervert
the natural taste, and foods containing their
natural amount of spices or extractives no longer
tempt one. Those whose nerves are highly keyed,
form the habit of seasoning the food too highly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
This undue stimulation calls for more food at the time
of eating than a normal appetite would demand.
The taste being cultivated for the stimulant, the
habit of eating too much food is formed.</p>

<p>A wise provision of Nature makes the system, in a
normal condition, its own regulator, protesting against
food when it has not assimilated or eliminated that
consumed. One should learn to obey such protests and
cut down the quantity when Nature calls “enough,”
and exercise to eliminate waste, thus creating a better
assimilation. Nature does not call for more food
until she has eliminated the excess of waste.</p>

<p>There are exceptions, however. Some phases of
indigestion cause a gnawing sensation in the stomach
which is often mistaken for a desire for food.
This is not a normal appetite. Water will usually
relieve it.</p>

<p>Often loss of appetite is the result of a clogging of
the intestines or liver, or is due to an excess of bile,
which, not having been properly discharged into the
intestines, has entered the blood stream or regurgitated
into the stomach. A torpid liver often expresses
itself in a dull mental force, the toxins deadening the
nerve cells.</p>

<p>The lack of desire for exercise of those living in
warm climates results in a sluggish activity of the
system. As a result it demands less food, and habits
of excessive seasoning to stimulate the appetite have
been formed.</p>

<p>The desire for excessive stimulants, such as salt,
may be a cultivated taste and the habit should be
corrected.</p>

<p>There is a difference between the cultivated and the
normal appetite. A child rarely shows a desire for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
stimulants such as tea or coffee, excessive salt, pepper,
pickles, catsups, etc., unless unwisely encouraged by
an adult, who does it, <em>not because it is food for the
child, but because the individual himself has cultivated
a taste for it</em>.</p>

<p>It is as easy to form healthful tastes and habits of
eating as unhealthful ones, and care should especially
be exercised over the formation of healthful habits
in the growing child.</p>

<p>One should not allow himself to become “finicky”
or no food will give him its best service.</p>

<p>Time, energy, muscular activity, nerve force, and
money are spent in combining, seasoning, and cooking
foods in such a manner as often to render them
difficult of digestion.</p>

<p>Let me repeat for emphasis—<em>when the appetite
wanes, deep breathing of fresh air to supply an abundance
of oxygen to oxidize the waste, thus putting it in
condition to be expelled from the system, brisk exercise
to accelerate the circulation, that the blood may carry
the oxygen freely and that the tissues may liberate the
carbon dioxid and other waste, and a copious drinking
of water, are the best tonics for loss of appetite or for a
lack of vitality</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Season
and Climate</div>

<p>The food required by the body varies
according to the season of the year and the
temperature. Thus, during cold weather,
the body craves hot foods and drinks, and the heavier
foods which furnish more heat-producing elements.
In summer, the lighter foods, fruits, and the proteins
supplied in green vegetables instead of in meats, are
relished, and cold foods and drinks are desired as aids
in equalizing the heat of the body. The total amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
of food taken in summer may be lessened because so
much food is not required to maintain the body heat
and energy. The lessened amount puts less strain
on the digestive system.</p>

<p>Owing to the increased perspiration, the desire for
water is greater in summer, while in winter or in cool
weather, from the opposite condition, the quantity of
water taken is usually insufficient.</p>

<p>In travel, when one shifts with more or less rapidity
from one temperature to another, the diet should not
be altered too greatly or too suddenly; the system
must be allowed time to accommodate itself to the
change.</p>

<p>The occupation must be taken into consideration.
Great muscular activity requires a more liberal diet
than a sedentary habit, no matter what the climate
may be.</p>

<p>Certain tribes that inhabit the tropics subsist
almost entirely on meat, while many of the inhabitants
of Russia and Norway live on breadstuffs almost
to the exclusion of meat.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Age</div>

<p>It is quite obvious that the food should
vary according to the body needs. The
needs of the adult, the child, and the infant vary.
The baby may not take the food which is required
by the child from the age of three to ten, and the
aged, not exercising vigorously, does not need the
hearty food of the growing child or the active adult.
The need for food depends, however, on activity
more than on years.</p>

<p>It is more difficult to make those in middle and
old age, who are not active, realize that the body no
longer needs so much food, due to the fact that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
not so actively building tissue, and that an oversupply
causes a serious tax on the digestive system. It brings
in its train ills which might easily be avoided by
simpler habits and a little study of the actual needs
of the body.</p>

<p>More food than the activity of the system demands,
taken in later or middle life, causes most of the diseases
which afflict this period. Obesity, arteriosclerosis,
liver disease, gastro-intestinal diseases, biliousness,
kidney diseases, gout, and allied conditions, can all
be traced to an overtaxed digestive system, with
faulty elimination and weakened organs. These
show the rebellion of Nature at being compelled to
work overtime.</p>

<p>While these diseases are most frequent after forty,
the condition of the system which designates age
is not always measured by years.</p>

<p>In the ordinary individual who has allowed himself
to sit and become lazy in his habit of life, certain
changes in the system occur and the body needs less
food than is required in more active life. There are
not such heavy calls on reserves for repair, either of
nerve force or of material.</p>

<p>Unless active exercises and interests have been kept
up, the muscular system begins to deteriorate, the
heart action is slower, and there is a lessening of nerve
tone. Relaxation of the digestive and intestinal organs
occurs, peristalsis is less vigorous, and the glands become
less active, owing to the lessened call for energy.
From this cause, unless the amount of food is reduced
in proportion to the body needs, constipation and
other digestive derangements may result.</p>

<p>If one stops physical and mental activity at any
age, the vital forces recede, muscles and vital organs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
become weak and inactive, and the waste of the system
is not fully eliminated. Such a man at thirty or forty
is physically and mentally older than the man who is
in active business or is taking daily vigorous exercise,
at seventy or eighty. The latter may follow the same
diet which he followed at fifty, while the former
should follow the diet of the old man who has stopped
active work.</p>

<p>Young men who through excessive drafts on their
vitality have exhausted their forces often act and
look twice their years. For these the diet should be
simple, easily digested, and nutritious, and often
reduced in quantity.</p>

<p>Formerly it was thought that at fifty years of age a
man or a woman was on the down-hill slope; they
were considered “aged.” Owing to the discoveries of
scientific tests of the condition of arteries and vital
organs, it is now known that years do not play so
large a part in the matter of age.</p>

<p>A man or a woman at fifty, who is in vigorous mental
and physical health, is in the prime of life, while many
from twenty-five to thirty, who have dissipated their
vital forces, may be said to have entered the age of
decrepitude. The saying, “Man is as old as his
arteries,” should be expanded to “Man is as old as
his tissues.”</p>

<p>People have thought too long that age is a matter
of years. They need to be aroused to recognize the
fact that the condition of age is a matter of health of
body and mind; that the spirit, which sees to it
that the body which it inhabits is kept vigorous and
strong by healthful and happy thoughts and an active
interest in the world’s affairs, is “young,” no matter
what the years number. Optimism and cheer keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
one young; pessimism and habits of mental depression
age one.</p>

<p>One of the encouraging signs of the times is that
more and more people are learning to know that their
activities need not be given up because they have
reached a certain age. If the children which formerly
needed care, have grown and gone to homes of their
own, the activities of the mother and father are freed
to find vent in other directions. If children no longer
need immediate care, the parents have time to make
better conditions for the children of others less fortunate.
They should interest themselves in public
questions that affect these children and their own,
indirectly if not directly. New life and strength
have been found by many by changing their activities
and keeping the thoughts young and the interest
vivid. The body will respond marvelously to the
mandates of the inner self.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Habit and
Regularity
of Eating</div>

<p>There is no doubt that the <em>habit</em> of eating
governs one’s convictions of what the
system requires. One is inclined to think
that a desire for a food is a requirement of
Nature; yet it may simply be the continuation of a
habit due to indigestion.</p>

<p>Chronic abnormal functioning of the organs, such
as is seen in indigestion, constipation, sluggish liver,
etc., are physical habits.</p>

<p>If a mother feeds her babe every three hours the
child will usually wake and call for food about this
period. If she has formed the habit of nursing the
child every two hours, it will call for food in about
two hours, even though all symptoms indicate that
the child is overfed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>It is important that both child and adult establish
regular and hygienic habits because the digestive
juices secrete themselves at the regular periods established.
<em>A right habit is as easily formed, and as difficult
to change, as a wrong one.</em></p>

<p>If one forms the habit of eating a certain amount of
food, the stomach calls for about the same amount,
and when one first begins to change the quantity it
protests, whether the change be to eat more or less.</p>

<p>Few people form the habit of drinking sufficient
water, particularly if they have been taught that
water at meals is injurious. In this busy life, few
remember to stop work and drink water between
meals, and if not consumed at the meal time the
system suffers. Many people look “dried up.”</p>

<p>The habit of drinking two glasses of water on first
arising, and six or eight more during the day is an
important one.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a large number of people
constantly overload the digestive organs. This, as
well as the bolting of food, insufficiently masticated,
cannot be too strongly denounced. <em>All food should
be chewed to a pulp before being swallowed.</em></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Frequency
of Meals</div>

<p>To avoid overeating, many theorists
are advocating two meals a day.</p>

<p>When two meals a day are eaten, the first
meal should be at nine or ten o’clock in the morning
and the second meal at five or six o’clock in the afternoon;
whereas, for the average person who eats two
meals a day, this custom means that he goes without
food until the midday meal and then eats two meals
within six hours, with nothing more for eighteen
hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>The argument in favor of two meals a day has been
that the digestive system is inactive during sleep,
and, therefore, it is not ready for a meal on arising.
Pawlow’s experiments, however, show that digestion
continues during sleep, though less actively; and it
must be borne in mind that the average evening meal
is eaten about six o’clock and that there are about
four waking hours between this meal and the sleep
period; also, that the average individual is awake and
moderately active an hour before the morning meal.
This gives five waking hours between the evening and
the morning meal. About the same time, five hours,
elapses between the morning and the midday meal,
and between the midday and the evening meal, so
that three meals a day divide the digestion periods
about evenly. If the amount of food supplied by
two meals seems to be sufficient for the needs of the
individual, and it is not practical to eat at the hours
stated, then omit the midday meal.</p>

<p>In the strain of business life, returning at once to
work, after the eating of a heavy meal in the middle
of the day, calls all of the surplus blood to the brain;
this, in many cases, results disastrously. For this
reason, the taking of the heavy meal at night, when
the system may relax and time be given to proper
digestion, has come to be an institution of city life.</p>

<p>More frequent meals, served in lighter quantity
with greater regularity, so that the system is not
overloaded at any one meal, is rational for delicate
or undernourished nerves and tissues.</p>

<p>The reason invalids or those whose digestive organs
are delicate should have the heaviest meal at midday,
is because the vigor of the system is greater at this
time than later in the day; the increased temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
in fever in the late afternoon retards assimilation.
Those whose digestive organs are delicate should not
be confined to three meals a day if less food taken
oftener is better borne and assimilated, but the meals
should be at regular times.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
Exercise and
Breathing
on Digestion</div>

<p>Food is stored in the muscles for immediate
use when needed. If all of the food
supplied to the muscles is not used for
their daily needs, an excess accumulates
unless the muscles are exercised sufficiently
to use up the supply. A constant accumulation
results in obesity. This condition, by overlaying the
organs with fat, compresses them and hampers their
activity. If the accumulation continues it ultimately
causes a degeneration of the tissues. Apoplexy occurs
in those carrying an excess of fat due to a weakening
of the walls of the arteries of the brain.</p>

<p>The blood, owing to variations in the external
temperature, has a tendency to retreat from the skin
through contraction of the capillaries and to engorge
the internal organs. Exercise brings the blood to the
skin and muscles, causing the waste, broken down by
the chemical activity going on every instant of life,
to be picked up by the blood and carried to the eliminating
organs. Therefore, since the blood is needed
in the digestive organs during digestion, active exercise
should not be taken immediately after meals.</p>

<p>Exercise taken in the proper amount and at proper
times uses up the excess of material, benefits digestion,
aids the work of the liver and intestines, keeps the
circulation active, the waste eliminated, and results
in a feeling of vigor and fitness for one’s work whether
physical or mental.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Exercise should be counted as a necessary part of
one’s daily activities—as necessary as eating one’s
meals. If faithfully done the habit will be formed and
the system will soon call for exercise as it does for
food.</p>

<p>The young child’s blood circulates freely, his breathing
is unrestricted, the waste of the system is fully
burned up, potential energy is released, and the result
is, he must be active. The effort of the teacher, or
of those having the care of children should be, not to
restrain the child but rather to direct his activity in
advantageous and effective use of his energy.</p>

<p>A little child is an object lesson in alternating exercise,
sleep, and food. Almost every waking moment
a child is squirming, twisting, and turning, using every
muscle of his little body, particularly every vital
organ. No excess of waste accumulates in his tissues.
The adult does not, as a rule, twist or turn or freely
stretch the muscles of the vital organs. The child
and the animal stretch and yawn to start the circulation
whenever they awaken from sleep. This is
instinct—Nature’s law. Man jumps out of bed and
begins dressing with mind bent on the business of the
day.</p>

<p>The necessity of oxygen is evident. The body will
subsist about forty days on the food stored within
it without resupply, but it can endure only a few
seconds without oxygen, because heat, occasioned by
the chemical action of oxygen, is necessary to keep
up the physical activity termed “life.” Carbon
dioxid (carbonic acid gas) accumulates and poisons
the system.</p>

<p><em>The necessity of habits of full, correct breathing cannot
be too fully emphasized.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>The quantity of oxygen daily consumed should
equal the sum of all other food elements.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Oxygen is necessary in the combustion of fats,
starches, and sugars, as it is necessary in the combustion
of carbon in wood or coal, and, as explained on
pages <a href="#Page_123">123</a> and <a href="#Page_124">124</a>, oxygen is necessary to keep the
body warm.</p>

<p>Deep breathing aids digestion and assimilation,
not only because of the regular exercise given to the
pancreas, the spleen, the stomach, and the liver by
the correct movement of the diaphragm, but also
because of the latent heat which the oxygen liberates
within the digestive organs and out among the tissues.</p>

<p>While the chemical action of food creates activity
within, this activity is materially aided by exercise.
Exercise and oxygen are also necessary for chemical
action in tearing down waste and in putting raw
material into condition to be appropriated to the body
needs.</p>

<p><em>Two glasses of water in the morning and fifteen
minutes of brisk exercise in well-selected movements,
to start a forceful circulation and to surge the water
through the digestive organs, are a daily necessity if one
is to keep clean and strong within.</em></p>

<p>Exercises should be interspersed with deep breathing
of <em>pure</em> air.</p>

<p>In breathing guard against drawing up the chest;
make the muscular effort, while practicing full breathing,
to expand the entire rib cage, back, front, and side.</p>

<p><em>It is as important to cleanse the body within as without.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
It is the method employed by all men and women
who would retain strong vital forces to a ripe old age.
They fully enjoy the mere</em> <span class="allsmcap">LIVING</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Ventilation</div>

<p>It is of the utmost importance that one
not only forms the habit of correct, full
breathing, but also sees to it that the air in the home,
or in the place of business, is pure. A window opened
at the top and bottom is essential in any place of
business—or at least a draft through the room.</p>

<p>There should be plenty of <em>circulating</em> air in the
sleeping room. Many restless nights are due to
stagnant air.</p>

<p>Teachers find that when they keep their schoolrooms
well ventilated the children are less restless, their
minds are more alert, they more quickly comprehend
what is said to them, and that both they and the
children are much less fatigued at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Proper ventilation, and proper exercise have so definite
a bearing on the condition of the body which we
term “tired” that this subject properly follows.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Fatigue,
Disturbed
Balance</div>

<p>Since the condition of the body in fatigue
so materially affects the digestion, absorption,
and assimilation of food, as well as
the elimination of waste, it is not amiss to
discuss it here.</p>

<p>The habit of eating when overfatigued is almost
sure to result in indigestion. Muscular or mental
activity has called the blood away from the digestive
organs and enough time has not elapsed to restore the
equilibrium. The digestive organs are not in condition
to take care of the food promptly and fermentation
begins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>A few minutes of active exercise and deep breathing
for the brain worker, or a half-hour of rest after muscular
activity, will equalize the circulation and restore
the blood to the stomach and intestines.</p>

<p>People fail to remember that the amount of blood
in the body is a fixed quantity, and if an excess of it
is called to one portion, the supply is lessened to other
portions.</p>

<p>The regular work of the body in keeping up the
heart action and the circulation requires a certain
amount of energy produced by a certain amount of
oxidized foodstuffs. The system in normal condition,
with normal breathing, readily furnishes this energy.
If more than the normal amount is used in increased
work, greater combustion is necessary. The extra
amount of waste which has been liberated by this extra
work must also be carried away. If combustion does
not take place, the extra energy is not supplied, and that
required for the constant bodily needs is called on.</p>

<p>If the waste is not removed from the system and
the energy not resupplied to the parts doing the extra
work, the muscles, nerves, and tissues are then in the
state termed “tired.” They remain so until the
circulation has carried the waste to the eliminating
organs and has brought more foodstuffs to the tissues,
thus restoring more energy than is needed for the
work constantly going on in the body.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that for combustion oxygen
is required and if undue energy is necessary deep
breathing is imperative.</p>

<p><em>The relief, then, from the state of the body we call
fatigue is in equalizing the circulation through exercise
or rest, according to the occupation, and supplying
oxygen through full breathing.</em> This more forceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
circulation calls the blood from the unduly distended
capillaries, removes the waste, and brings a new supply
of energy-building foodstuffs.</p>

<p>In mental work, the nerves and the brain call for
the surplus energy, while in muscular work the tissues
require it, hence undue work, either mental or physical,
expresses itself in bodily fatigue, until the demand
in all parts of the body is equalized.</p>

<p>When equilibrium is restored, the body is “rested.”</p>

<p>The relief from fatigue due to mental activity is
in exercise and deep breathing.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxid dulls the nerves of sensation and the
brain action and may produce more or less stupor.
It may be because the circulation in some part of the
body is sluggish (most often the portal circulation
through the liver), so that sufficient oxygen is not
carried to that part.</p>

<p>Relief from this “inertness” is experienced most
quickly by exercise to quicken the circulation and
supply the oxygen. Exercise in one’s room by the
open window, or at least with the air in the room pure,
is often preferable to outdoor exercise, because the
body can be nude, or so loosely clothed that the oxygen
may not only enter the lungs but also circulate
about the skin.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes of brisk exercise in one’s room is
better than a five-mile walk, because if the exercises
are intelligently selected, every organ and tissue is
used, while walking exercises only about one-fourth
of the muscles.</p>

<p>After sleeping in a room in which the air is impure,
one arises fatigued, because the supply of oxygen is
insufficient to liberate the energy required for circulation
and catabolism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p><em>Harmony</em>, either mental or physical, <em>is rest</em>.</p>

<p>With a little more intelligence in keeping up the
supply of oxygen, in establishing correct breathing
habits, and in understanding the law of distribution of
circulation, which means the harmony of forces, this
tired world could not only draw a deep, restful breath,
but would be invigorated to enjoy life to the full.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Sleep</div>

<p>During sleep all the processes of the
body are retarded.</p>

<p>Blood flow and breathing become slower and the
digestive processes slacken. For this reason, if one
goes to bed immediately after eating a heavy meal,
digestion is retarded. This may react on the nerves,
producing fitful or unrestful sleep. Fever or nightmare
may result. The annoying, sleepy feeling which
often comes on after a meal indicates a lack of balance
in the system—usually that more food has been eaten
than the body requires. Lessening the amount of
food and increasing the exercise and the oxygen, and
cleansing the intestinal tract will prevent it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the alimentary tract is entirely
empty, sleep may not come because there is too much
blood in the brain. A glass of hot milk or cocoa, or a
couple of crackers, will call the blood to the stomach
and will often aid sleep.</p>

<p>After eating a heavy meal, from three to three and
a half hours should elapse before retiring for sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Influence of
the Mind</div>

<p>The state of mind has much to do with
regulating the digestive system. Cheerful
thoughts keep the nerves of the entire
organism in a normal state, while disagreeable thoughts
cause a tense, unnatural condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>The nerves of the digestive organs are affected by
the tenseness of the mind, just as are the nerves to
any other part of the body. As an illustration, if
one continuously thinks ugly, disagreeable thoughts,
these thoughts affect the chemical activities of digestion
and assimilation, resulting in an excess of acid
in the blood, and actual illness results. Digestion
and assimilation being impaired, the tissues become
weakened, they lose their resistance, and, as a result,
the organs may prolapse. We then have what is
called a “vicious circle”—the mind affects the body
unpleasantly and the body the mind.</p>

<p>We are learning to consider many factors in looking
for the causes of disease, particularly those due to
general weakness, or a disturbed mental state. Even
the temper shown in a crying babe may affect its
digestion by disturbing the normal chemical activity.</p>

<p>Among the blood and digestive disturbances which
may result from anxiety, worry, fear, or disagreeable
thoughts, are anemia, neurasthenia, indigestion,
constipation, prolapsed viscera, and, in fact, all
diseases which result from faulty nutrition and resultant
weakened tissues.</p>

<p>Disagreeable thoughts affect the appetite, in fact
they sometimes cause it to be entirely lost.</p>

<p>All so-called “new thought,” “ologies,” or “isms,”
conducive to the formation of the habit of looking
on the bright side of life, or of looking for good and
joy in life, of kindness, love, and helpfulness, favorably
affect the digestion and consequently the health.
The practice is Christian <em>Sense</em>.</p>

<p>The nerves control the peristaltic movements of
the stomach and the action of the absorptive cells, as
well as the cells which secrete the digestive juices.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Thus it is that a food which one likes is not only more
palatable, but it will also digest more readily, the
digestive juices flowing more freely because of the
mental stimulus.</p>

<p>It is well, therefore, to begin the meal with something
especially appetizing, that the flow of the digestive
juices may be incited. For this reason, if one
cares for fruit, it is an excellent custom to begin the
meal with fruit, or with a well-made soup, containing
protein extractives, which will stimulate the flow of
digestive juices.</p>

<p>The habit of finishing a meal with some tasty dessert
is based on the scientific principle that its palatability
will cause the gastric juices to flow more
freely after the meal, thus aiding in its digestion.</p>

<p>Dainty service in a sick-room, because of the psychic
effect of a meal daintily served, is of utmost importance.
Because of the effect on the mind, the sight of
a meal served on soiled linen will almost stop the
flow of gastric juice and will destroy the desire for
food, while a meal well served on dainty linen, with
garnishings and tasteful table decorations, incites
the flow of gastric juices.</p>

<p>The careful wife and mother, who notes any failure
of appetite in members of her family, should attend
carefully to the garnishing of her dishes and to serving
them in a neat, attractive manner; also to changing
her table decorations, so far as may be consistent
that the eye as well as the sense of smell and taste
may be pleased and the effect of the mind on digestion
be exerted.</p>

<p>It is strange, but it is true, that a fresh flower, or a
new table decoration, may so pleasantly affect one
afflicted with nervous indigestion that the meal more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
readily digests, while an untidy table, or a lot of food
served untidily will retard digestion.</p>

<p>The custom, among hearty eaters, of serving a
plate too plentifully, destroys the appetite of one
whose digestion is not so active. Our grandmother’s
overloaded table, with sufficient food of various kinds
to serve many times the number of participants,
might stimulate the appetite of hearty, strong men,
but the very sight of so much might turn the appetite
of one more delicate.</p>

<p>The mind must be relaxed and directed to pleasant
themes during a meal or the condition of the nerves
of the digestive organs will not permit a free secretion
of digestive juices. Chronic indigestion is sure to
result from this practice. Dinner, or the hearty meal
at night, rather than at noon, is preferable for the
business or professional man or woman, because the
cares of the day are over and the brain force relaxes.
The vital forces are not detracted from the work of
digestion.</p>

<p>Foods which are forced down, with a mind arrayed
against them, do not digest so readily, because the
dislike hinders the flow of the gastric juices. Any
food fails of prompt digestion when the nerves controlling
the stomach are acting feebly; however,
while they digest more slowly during mental protest,
they <em>do</em> nourish the system.</p>

<p>Likes and dislikes are largely mental. Certain
foods continuously disagree and they should be
avoided; but many abstain from wholesome food
because it has disagreed a <em>few</em> times. It may be that
it was not the particular food but the weakness of the
stomach at the time.</p>

<p>Many foods disagree at certain times because of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
particular conditions regulating the secretion of
digestive juices. When this condition has continued
for some time it becomes chronic and a special diet
is required, together with special exercises, to bring a
better blood supply to stomach and intestines and to
regulate the nerves controlling them, in order to
correct the abnormality.</p>

<p>One may so form the habit of criticism or of being
disgruntled or thinking he cannot eat this food and
that, that his entire system suffers. Much indigestion
is more mental than physical.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Effect
of the
Circulation</div>

<p>It can be readily seen that any tissue,
playing so important a part in digestion as
the blood, needs to be kept in as nearly
perfect condition as possible. A vigorous
circulation stimulates digestion; a poor circulation
retards it.</p>

<p>If the blood is poor in quality the digestive organs
are not nourished and the digestive secretions are
lessened in quantity and quality.</p>

<p>If the blood is imperfectly aërated it carries an
insufficient supply of oxygen, combustion is lessened,
and the waste, not being in a condition to be removed,
remains in the tissues, stagnation results, and a slow
poisoning process goes on which gradually causes the
system to fail to meet the demands made on it.</p>

<p>The blood tissue can only be kept in condition by
an adequate but not excessive amount of good food
taken at the proper time, and such active exercise
as will thoroughly aërate the blood by bringing the
air to the smallest air cells in the lungs.</p>

<p>If one would fight to prevent the money used in
daily exchange from being debased, he ought to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
much more ready to use every means in his power to
prevent a deterioration of the blood, that medium of
exchange in his body on which such vital issues depend.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Tobacco
and
Alcohol</div>

<p>Tobacco and alcohol are two substances
which, in excess, materially retard digestion.</p>

<p>The effect tobacco on the stomach is
shown by its action on the small boy with
his first cigar. Habituated to its use, the nerves
become blunted and the nicotin narcotizes them.
The use of tobacco renders the sense of taste less delicate,
due to the action of the nicotin on the nerves of
the taste buds. Men who use tobacco in excess miss
the pleasures of taste; all food tastes much alike to
them.</p>

<p>Tobacco, due to its action on the vagus nerve,
many times causes disorders both of circulation and
digestion. The starches are usually not well digested
by those who are habitual users of tobacco.</p>

<p>Smoking before meals or when the stomach is
empty often occasions nausea.</p>

<p>Because of its narcotic action it often exerts a
soothing influence particularly in men of highly nervous
temperament who are unwilling to take the
necessary exercise to equalize nerve activity.</p>

<p>It was formerly held by physiologists that alcohol
was a food, because its oxidation liberates heat, and
it was assumed that this liberation of heat was the
same as that freed by the combustion of fats, starches,
and sugars uniting with oxygen. More recent knowledge,
however, has unquestionably determined that
the body decomposes alcohol into carbon dioxid and
water, thus liberating heat, yet the reaction produces
cold and the body requires more heat to warm it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>The blood-vessels of the skin dilate from overstimulation,
and heat is radiated faster than it is
generated, so that the temperature of the body is really
lowered though alcohol gives a sensation of heat.
The body, therefore, loses the power to resist cold.</p>

<p>It was formerly used by physicians for its supposed
stimulant action, but it has been determined that the
apparent stimulant effect is due to irritation of the
nerves, particularly of the nerves of the stomach;
the temporary spur to activity is followed, however,
by depression of the body forces.</p>

<p>The habitual use of alcohol, from overstimulation
of the nervous system, affects this system, deranging
it permanently, gradually lowering both mental and
physical ability, and causing a catarrhal condition of
the stomach and intestines.</p>

<p><em>Alcohol, therefore, even in small quantities, is a
poison, and not a food.</em></p>

<p>In certain conditions it may be used in emergency
to spur a flagging or failing organism to action, but
owing to the facility with which the alcohol habit is
acquired its use should not be continued beyond
the period when its immediate action is deemed
necessary.</p>

<p>Because tobacco and alcohol are both poisons, the
healthy organism has no need of them. The diseased
or deranged organism can often find greater benefit
from natural remedies than from the artificial stimuli
of these substances.</p>

<p>It is a known fact that far more men than women
suffer from dyspepsia. One reason for this may be
found in the prevalent habit of spitting. Smokers,
in whom the irritation of the nicotin causes an excess
of saliva, often suffer from gastric troubles, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
they expectorate, thus wasting this valuable digestive
juice.</p>

<p>Aside from the filthiness of the habit, which has
caused laws to be enacted against it, one would think
that a little reflection would cause those addicted to
it to consider what it means to their health. Overstimulation
means weakened salivary glands, impaired
secretion, and consequent lessened digestive power.
For the sake of their own health if not from
motives of decency, men should abandon the habit of
expectorating.</p>

<span class="fs80">COOKING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> question of the proper selection and cooking
of food is so vital to the health and resultant
happiness of every family, and to the strength and well
being of a nation, that every one to whom cooking is
entrusted should have special preparation for the
work. Every girl should be given practical and
thorough training in dietetics in our public schools.
The study is as dignified as the study of music and
art. Indeed it can be made an art in the highest
conception of the term. Surely the education of
every girl in the vocation in which she sooner or later
may engage, either actively or by directing others,
means more than education in music and drawing.</p>

<p>We must all eat two and three times every day;
there are few things which we do so regularly and
which are so vital; yet in the past we have given this
subject less study than any common branch in our
schools. When the dignity of the profession of
dietetics is realized, the servant problem will be
largely solved.</p>

<p>The wholesome cooking of food is as important as
its selection, because the manner of cooking makes it
easier or more difficult of digestion.</p>

<p>The necessity of a thorough education in this regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
is recognized by men who follow cooking as a profession,
and a regular apprenticeship must be served before
a cook is recognized as proficient. He can then
command good wages.</p>

<p>In cooking any food, heat and moisture are necessary,
the time needed varying from thirty minutes to
several hours. Baked beans, and meats containing
much connective tissue, as boiling and roasting cuts,
require the longest time.</p>

<p>The purposes in the cooking of foods are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To develop the flavor which makes the food
appetizing, thus encouraging the flow of gastric
juice;</p>

<p>To sterilize, thereby killing all parasites and
microörganisms, such as the tapeworm in beef,
pork, and mutton, and the trichinæ in pork;</p>

<p>To convert the nutrients into a more digestible
form, by partially or wholly converting the connective
tissue into gelatin.</p>
</div>

<p>According to the variety and kind, food may be
roasted, broiled, boiled, stewed, baked, steamed, or
fried.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Cooking
of Meats</div>

<p>The fundamental principle to be observed
in the cooking of meat concerns
the retention of the juices, since these
contain a large part of the nutriment. The heat
develops the flavor, and the moisture together with
the heat dissolves the connective tissue and makes it
tender.</p>

<p>A choice piece of meat may be toughened and made
difficult of digestion, or a tough piece may be made
tender and easy to digest, by the manner of cooking.</p>

<p><em>Soups.</em> To make meat soups, the connective tissue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
bone and muscle should be put into cold water, brought
<em>slowly</em> to the boiling point, and allowed to simmer for
several hours.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the gelatin from this
connective tissue does not contain the tissue-building
elements of the albuminoids. These are retained in
the meat and about the bones of the boiling piece.</p>

<p>The albumin of meat is largely in the blood and it
is the coagulated blood which forms the scum on
soup. Soup should cook slowly, or much of the
nutrition is lost in the coagulated blood, or scum.</p>

<p>If a soup containing nutrition is desired, it must be
made from boiling meat, connective tissue, and bone
with marrow.</p>

<p>While bouillons and prepared cubes contain very
little nutriment they contain the extractives, and the
flavors increase the flow of digestive juices and stimulate
the appetite. It is for this reason that soups
are served before a meal; when they are relished, they
aid a copious flow of gastric juice and saliva.</p>

<p>Many mistake the extractives and flavor for nourishment,
thinking that soups are an easy method of
taking food, but the best part of the nutriment remains
in the meat or vegetables from which the
soup is made, and unless one desires merely the stimulating
effect, bread or crackers should supply the
nourishment.</p>

<p>If soup meat is used in hashes the lost nutritive
material in the form of gelatinoids and extractives
may be restored by adding to it a cup of rich soup stock.</p>

<p>In preparing <em>Beef Tea</em>, the meat should be finely
minced, placed in a mason jar, and a very little cold
water added. It should stand an hour or two to aid
in the extraction of the albumin. The jar should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
then placed in a kettle of water which should be kept
at the boiling point for two hours. In this way none
of the nutriment is lost. Beef tea, if properly prepared
and only the juice is used, is expensive, but
when concentrated nourishment is necessary, cost
should not figure.</p>

<p>The beef teas made from cubes contain the extractives
and are appetizers, but they contain very
little if any nutrition.</p>

<p><em>Roasting.</em> Roasting and broiling of meats are the
most universally used methods. The savage as well
as civilized man prepares his meat by direct application
of heat without water.</p>

<p>In roasting or broiling the meat is subjected suddenly
to a high temperature which coagulates the albumin
of the outer layers and prevents the escape of
the juices. For this reason the oven should be thoroughly
hot before the roast is put in. Unless the
heat is sufficient to sear the surface, the moisture, or
juice, will escape and the connective tissue will be
toughened.</p>

<p>The roast should be turned as soon as one side is
seared and just enough water added to prevent it from
burning.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that the smaller the
cut to be roasted, the hotter should be the fire. An
intensely hot fire coagulates the exterior and prevents
the drying up of the meat juice. After the surface
is coagulated and seared, to prevent the evaporation
of its juices, the roast should be covered so as to cook
more slowly to prevent too great hardening of the
surface.</p>

<p>Frequent basting of a roast with the fat, juice, and
water in the roasting pan, still further sears the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
so that the juices do not seep through, and keeps
the air in the pan moist; the heated moisture materially
assists in gelatinizing the connective tissue. Roasting
pans are now made which are self-basting.</p>

<p>Raising the temperature of the juices subjects the
inner portions of the meat to moist heat and it is thus
stewed in its own juices. The retention of these
juices and of the extractives adds to the flavor and the
palatability.</p>

<p>Roasted or broiled meats, if properly cooked, are
more readily digested and they are usually most
relished because their flavor is better retained.</p>

<p><em>Pot Roasts.</em> For a pot roast, the meat should be
well seared in fat, then a small amount of water added,
and the meat cooked <em>slowly</em> at about 180 F., until
done. A fireless cooker is excellent for this as for any
other food needing to be slowly cooked. The juices
seep out in the water and form a rich gravy which
should be served with the meat.</p>

<p><em>Broiling.</em> The same principle of quickly searing
the surface applies to broiling. In broiling, however,
the heat is applied direct, because the process is
quicker. The meat is placed over a very hot flame
or hot coals and both sides quickly seared to prevent
the juice from escaping.</p>

<p>The object of the direct application of the heat is
to enable it to quickly penetrate to the center of the
chop or steak so as to coagulate the albumin and prevent
the escape of the water. Meat intended for
broiling should be cut at least an inch thick, as otherwise
it becomes too hard and dry in the process of
broiling.</p>

<p>Meat containing much connective tissue, such as
the neck, chuck, and rump, is not adapted to broiling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
because it takes too long for this tissue to become
gelatinized. It may be pan broiled, a little water
added, and cooked slowly until done. Prepared in
this way it is cheap, nourishing, and palatable.</p>

<p>Steak broiled in a skillet, especially round steak
which has been pounded to assist in breaking the
connective tissue, is often first dipped in seasoned
flour, which is well worked into it. The flour absorbs
the meat juices so that none of them are lost.</p>

<p>When broiling meats in a skillet the skillet must be
very hot before the meat is placed on it, and as soon
as one surface of the meat is seared, it should be
turned to sear the other side. The skillet should be
kept covered so as to retain the moisture.</p>

<p><em>Boiling.</em> One important fact, too frequently overlooked,
or, perhaps, not known by many cooks, is
that when water has reached the boiling point its
temperature cannot be further raised by increasing the
heat applied. The addition of heat only increases
the production of steam and causes the water to
“boil away.” Therefore as soon as the water has
begun to boil the gas may be turned down or the fire
kept at just the level necessary to maintain the boiling.
The food cooks just as soon and the fuel bills are
lowered. Hard boiling has no greater effect on any
food than moderate boiling.</p>

<p>When boiled meat is intended to be eaten—not
merely boiled for soup—the water should be boiling
when the meat is placed in it in order that the albumin
on the surface may be immediately coagulated and
prevent the escape of the nutrients into the water.
It is impossible to make a rich broth and to have a
juicy, highly flavored piece of boiled meat at the
same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Meats used for boiling contain more connective
tissue, therefore they require much longer cooking
in order to gelatinize this tissue. They are not as
rich in protein as are steaks.</p>

<p>Meat “shrinks” in boiling because of the escape
of the water in the tissues into the water in which it
is boiled. Meat may thus lose one-fourth to one-third
of its weight and bulk.</p>

<p><em>Stewing.</em> This differs from boiling in that the
temperature is lower and the meat or vegetables are
cut in pieces so that the water may come in contact
with more of the surface thus aiding in the extraction
of the juices.</p>

<p>The scum, which appears on the surface of a stew,
is usually skimmed off and, as in the case of soups,
much nutrition is lost. It should be retained, as it
will disappear when the stew is thickened. It is usually
removed from beef tea in order that it may not
offend the eye or the capricious appetite of an invalid.</p>

<p>Stews should be covered and should not be cooked
in too much water, as the juices are weakened and
too great an amount of flour is necessary to thicken
them, thus rendering them less digestible. They are
cooked slowly at low temperature (130 to 160 F.)
and so do not need much water.</p>

<p>If properly made, stews are both economical and
nutritious, as no nutrition is lost in evaporation and
all material save bone or gristle is utilized.</p>

<p><em>Baking.</em> Meats, when baked, are covered with a
crust, either of batter or pastry. This prevents the
escape of the volatile matters, and meats thus cooked
are richer, especially if they contain much fat. For
this reason they are seldom suitable for invalids, or
for those who have any form of stomach trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p><em>Steaming.</em> This method of cooking is applied
mainly to vegetables, puddings, etc. Steamed puddings
and dumplings are softer than when baked.
The cover must not be removed during the time of
steaming, or they may become soggy, hence less
digestible.</p>

<p><em>Frying.</em> This is the least desirable method of cooking.
If a lighted match is placed near the smoke of
superheated fat the fat will catch fire, showing that it
is volatilizing, or being reduced to a vapor.</p>

<p>The extreme heat liberates fatty acids which soak
into the food and render it difficult of digestion. It
is wise not to employ this method of cooking unless
the food is completely immersed in the hot fat by
means of a wire basket. This facilitates its removal
with greater ease. The surface albumin is coagulated
more quickly when the food is submerged, thus preventing
it from soaking up too great an amount of fat.</p>

<p>Deep-fat cooking requires close watching and for
this reason most cooks use a skillet. Unless the
skillet is very hot and the meat is turned frequently,
the meat juices are lost both by evaporation and by
the meat adhering to the pan.</p>

<p>In cooking in deep fat, if not left too long and if
the fat is at the right heat, the meat fibers do not
soak up the fat, because the water in the tissues is so
rapidly turned to steam that the fat cannot enter;
the interior thus cooks in its own juices as in roasting
or broiling. Fish or chops fried in deep fat are palatable
and of high flavor. Boiled fish, however, if the
water is well salted to prevent too great softening, is
better for invalids, as it is more easily digested.</p>

<p>Fish fried whole in deep fat may have the skin
removed after frying. The fish fibers are thus not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
brought into contact with the fat. Special utensils
for frying fish in this way may now be obtained.</p>

<p>Fats are readily absorbed in their natural condition,
but, if changed by extreme heat, they are irritants.</p>

<p><em>For digestibility, therefore, boiled, broiled, and roasted
foods are preferable to foods cooked in fats.</em></p>

<p>Such food as fried potatoes, mush, eggs, French
toast, and griddle cakes, cooked by putting a little
grease into a frying pan, are more difficult of digestion
than foods cooked by any other means, particularly
when the fat is heated so that it smokes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cooking of
Cereals</div>

<p>One safe rule is to cook most foods too
much rather than too little; overcooking
is uncommon and harmless, while <em>undercooked</em>
foods are common and difficult of digestion.</p>

<p>All partially cooked cereal foods should be cooked
at least as long as specified in the directions.</p>

<p>One reason why breakfast foods, such as rolled
oats, are partially cooked by the manufacturer, is
because they keep longer.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the nutrients of the grain are
found inside the starch-bearing and other cells, and
the walls of these cells are made of crude fiber, on
which the digestive juices have little effect. Unless
the cell walls are broken down, the nutrients can not
come under the influence of the digestive juices until
the digestive organs have expended material and
energy in getting at them. Crushing the grain in
mills and making it still finer by thorough mastication
breaks many of the cell walls, and the action of
the saliva and other digestive juices also disintegrates
them more or less, but the heat of cooking accomplishes
the object much more thoroughly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>The invisible moisture in the cells expands under
the action of heat, and the cell walls burst. The
water added in cooking also plays an important part
in softening and rupturing them. The cellulose or
cell wall is also changed by heat to a more soluble
form. Heat makes the starch in the cells at least
partially soluble, especially when water is present.</p>

<p>The solubility of the protein is probably, as a rule,
somewhat lessened by cooking, especially at higher
temperatures. Long, slow cooking is therefore better,
as it breaks down the crude fiber and changes the
starch to a soluble form without materially decreasing
the solubility of the protein.</p>

<p>The fireless cooker is particularly desirable in the
cooking of cereals.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>In experiments made with rolled oats at the Minnesota Experiment
Station, it appeared that cooking (four hours) did not
make the starch much more soluble. However, it so changed the
physical structure of the grains that a given amount of digestive
ferment could render much more of it soluble in a given time
than when it was cooked for only half an hour.</p>

<p>On the basis of the results obtained, the difficulty commonly
experienced in digesting imperfectly cooked oatmeal was attributed
to the large amounts of glutinous material which surrounds
the starch grains and prevent their disintegration. When thoroughly
cooked the protecting action of the mucilaginous protein
is overcome, and the compound starch granules are sufficiently
disintegrated to allow the digestive juices to act. In other words
the increased digestibility of the thoroughly cooked cereal is
supposed to be largely due to a physical change in the carbohydrates,
which renders them more susceptible to the action of
digestive juices.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Pastry.</em> Pastry is usually difficult of digestion
because the fat it contains interferes with the proper
solution of the starch. The objectionable features<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
apply to such pastry as is made by rubbing fat into
flour, as in pie crust, crust for meat pies, apple dumplings,
etc. It does not apply to most puddings.
Butter or fat is used in cakes, cookies, etc., but it is
not rubbed into the flour; it is mixed with sugar and
eggs which hold it in suspension until the flour is
acted on by the liquids.</p>

<p>The coating of the starch granules with fat prevents
them from coming in contact with liquids. The fat
does not furnish sufficient water to enable the cells
to swell and dissolve the cell wall and so coats the
starch granules as to prevent them from absorbing
water in mixing, or saliva in mastication. This
coating of fat is not removed until late in the
process of digestion, or until the food reaches the
intestines.</p>

<p>The same objection applies to rich gravies, unless
the flour is dissolved in water and heated before
being mixed with the fats.</p>

<p>Pastry and biscuits require a somewhat hotter
temperature than bread, because the process of cooking
consumes less time.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cooking of
Vegetables</div>

<p>Since the root vegetables contain a
large proportion of carbohydrates, they
should be well cooked, in order that the
crude fiber may be broken and the cells fully dissolved.
Most vegetables are unpalatable and indigestible
unless, by the cooking process, the starch granules
are broken.</p>

<p>Vegetables are best cooked in soft water as lime
or magnesia, the chemical ingredients which make
water “hard,” make the vegetables less soluble.</p>

<p>Vegetables and fruits become contaminated with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
eggs of numerous parasites from the fertilizers used;
hence they should be thoroughly washed.</p>

<p>The objections to frying are as strong in regard to
vegetables as to meats. The coating of fat retards
digestion, as shown on page <a href="#Page_195">195</a>.</p>

<p>The objection to frying does not hold so strongly
in the case of vegetables, such as potatoes, if fried
<em>slowly</em> in fat that is not overheated, or to griddle cakes
cooked slowly without smoke. It does apply, however,
if the fat is sufficiently heated to smoke.</p>

<p>The coating of vegetables and cereals with fat prevents
the necessary action of saliva on the starch
globules. As previously stated, starch digestion is
begun in the mouth and continued for a short time in
the stomach, while the fats are not emulsified until
they reach the intestine.</p>

<p>The starch granules in cereals and vegetables are
in cells, the covering of which is composed largely of
nitrogenous matter. The protein is not acted on by
the saliva, and the nitrogenous matter is largely
digested in the stomach. It is more easily dissolved
if it is broken or softened by cooking, so that the
carbohydrates can come in contact with the saliva,
but if encased in fat, the gastric juices cannot digest
the protein covering and the saliva cannot reach the
starch until the fat is emulsified in the intestines.
This means that whenever starch globules are surrounded
with fat, the digestive ferments reach these
globules with difficulty and foods improperly fried
must be digested mostly in the intestines. For this
reason, eggs, poached or boiled, are more easily
digested than when fried.</p>

<p>Vegetables and fruits of most sorts may be baked
and are usually rendered more digestible by the process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>Tubers of all sorts, if to be cooked by boiling, should
be put on the fire in cold water. The gradual heating
of the water allows the tuber to become warmed
through before boiling begins and the interior and
exterior thus are completely cooked about the same
time. If placed in boiling water, the exterior, being
cooked before the interior, particularly when vegetables
are peeled before cooking, either separates, as in
potatoes, making them “mushy,” or the vegetables
are served with the interior not thoroughly cooked.</p>

<p>Vegetables will cook as quickly and more evenly
in water kept just at the boiling point as in water
that is boiling hard.</p>

<p>All pods, seeds, or leaves, as in green vegetables,
should be put in boiling water that none of the nutritive
material may be lost and that the cooking action
may be quickly begun.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Cooking of
Fruit</div>

<p>Opinions differ markedly regarding the
relative wholesomeness of raw and cooked
fruit. Europeans use comparatively little
raw fruit, it being considered less wholesome than
cooked fruit. In the United States, raw fruit is
considered extremely wholesome, and is used in very
large quantities; it is relished quite as much as cooked
fruit, if indeed it is not preferred to it.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the European prejudice
against raw fruit may be an unconscious protest
against unsanitary methods of marketing or handling
and the recognition of cooking as a practical method
of preventing the spread of disease by fruit soiled
with fertilizers or with street dust. If the cooking
is thorough, it insures sterilization.</p>

<p>As with all vegetable foods, the heat of cooking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
dissolves the fiber in the cell walls. The moisture
causes the cell contents to expand and rupture the
walls. The change in texture occasioned by cooking
renders it softer, more palatable, and more readily
acted on by the digestive juices. This is obviously
of more importance with the fruits like the quince,
which is so hard that it is unpalatable raw, than it is
with soft fruits like strawberries.</p>

<p>Cooking in water extracts so little of the nutritive
material present in fruit that such removal of nutrition
is of no practical importance unless the amount
of water used is excessive. Because they contain
much water fruits should be cooked in as little water
as may be necessary to prevent them from burning.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>The idea is quite generally held that cooking fruit changes its
acid content, acid being sometimes increased and sometimes
decreased by the cooking process. Kelhofer showed that when
gooseberries were cooked with sugar, the acid content was not
materially changed, these results being in accord with his conclusions
reached in earlier studies with other fruits. The sweeter
taste of the cooked product he believed to be simply due to the
fact that sugar masks the flavor of the acid.</p>

<p>It is often noted that cooked fruits, such as plums, seem much
sourer than the raw fruit, and it has been suggested that either
the acid was increased or the sugar was decreased by the cooking
process. This problem was studied by Sutherst, and, in his
opinion, the increased acid flavor is due to the fact that cooked
fruit (gooseberries, currants, plums, etc.) usually contains the
skin, which is commonly rejected if the fruit is eaten raw. The
skin is more acid than the simpler carbohydrates united to form
a complex carbohydrate.</p>

<p>In some fruits, like the apple, where the jelly-yielding material
must be extracted with hot water, the pectin is apparently united
with cellulose as a part of the solid pulp. As shown by the
investigations of Bigelow and Gore at the Bureau of Chemistry,
forty per cent. of the solid material of apple pulp may be thus
extracted with hot water, and consists of two carbohydrates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
one of which is closely related to gum arabic. That such carbohydrates
as these should yield a jelly is not surprising when
we remember that they are similar to starch in their chemical
nature, and, as everyone knows, starch, though insoluble in
cold water, yields when cooked with hot water a large proportion
of paste, which jellies on cooling.</p>

<p>When fruits are used for making pies, puddings, etc., the nutritive
value of the dish is, of course, increased by the addition of
flour, sugar, etc., and the dish as a whole may constitute a better
balanced food than the fruit alone.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<span class="fs80">FOOD REQUIREMENTS OF THE SYSTEM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span> previously stated, the object of foods is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To supply the needs of the body in building
new tissue as in the growing child.</p>

<p>To repair tissue which the catabolic activity
of the body is constantly tearing down and
eliminating; and</p>

<p>To supply heat and energy.</p>
</div>

<p>The heat and energy are not alone for muscular
activity in exercise or movement. It must be kept in
mind also that the body is a busy workshop, or chemical
laboratory, and heat and energy are needed in the
constant metabolism of tearing down and rebuilding
tissue and in the work of digestion and elimination.</p>

<p>In this chapter, a few points given in the preceding
pages are repeated for emphasis.</p>

<p>The proteins represented in purest form in lean meat
build tissue, and the carbonaceous foods, starches,
sugars, and fats, supply the heat and energy.</p>

<p>An excess of proteins, that is, more than is needed for
building and repair, is also used for heat and energy.</p>

<p>The waste products of the nitrogenous foods are
broken down into carbon dioxid, sulphates, phosphates,
and other nitrogenous compounds, and excreted
through the kidneys, skin, and the bile, while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
waste product of carbonaceous foods is largely carbon
dioxid and is excreted mostly through the lungs.</p>

<p>Since the foods richest in protein are the most
expensive, those who wish to keep down the cost of
living, should provide, at most, no more protein
than the system requires. Expensive meats may be
eliminated and proteins be supplied by eggs, milk,
legumes, and nuts.</p>

<p>The fundamental thing is to decide on the amount
of protein—two to four ounces, nearly a quarter of a
pound a day—and then select a dietary which shall
provide this and also supply heat and energy sufficient
for the day.</p>

<p>If the diet is to include meat, a goodly proportion
of protein will be furnished in the lean meat. This
will vary greatly with the different cuts of meat, as
shown in Table IV, page <a href="#Page_54">54</a>. If, as often happens,
one does not care for fats, then the starches and
sugars must provide the heat. If much sugar is
eaten less starches and fats are needed.</p>

<p>The normally healthy individual is more liable to
take too much protein than too little, even though he
abstain from meat.</p>

<p>If the diet is to include meat, it will be of less bulk,
because the protein is more condensed; for the same
reason, if it includes animal products of eggs and milk
and a fair proportion of legumes, it will be less bulky
than a vegetable diet. Yet unless vegetables, fruits,
and plenty of water are consumed one must guard
against constipation. This point is important for
busy people who eat their meals in a hurry and
proceed at once to active mental work.</p>

<p>Those who engage in physical labor are much more
likely to take a complete rest for a half-hour, or an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
hour, after eating. The <em>thinkers</em> seldom rest, at least
after a midday meal, and those who worry seldom relax
the mental force during any waking hour; their
brains are as active as those of mental workers.</p>

<p>Every housewife, to intelligently select the daily
menus for her family, needs a thorough knowledge
of dietetics. She must understand the chemistry
of food that she may know food values.</p>

<p>The difficulty which confronts the housewife is to
provide a meal suited to the needs, tastes, or idiosyncrasies
of the various members of her household.
Peculiarities of taste, unless these peculiarities have
been intelligently acquired, may result in digestive
disturbances. As an illustration: one may cultivate
a dislike for meat, milk, or eggs, as is often the case,
and if the proteins for the family is largely supplied
by these, the individual who omits them from the
meal, eats too large a proportion of starches and
sugars, and not sufficient protein—legumes, nuts,
etc. If this is long continued the blood becomes
impoverished and anemia is produced.</p>

<p>The relief lies in <em>cultivating a taste for all foods</em>.</p>

<p>In active work, more heat is liberated, thus more
fat, starches, and sugar are required for the resupply.
As previously stated, if an excess of starch (glycogen)
is stored in the liver, or an excess of fat in the tissues,
this excess is called on to supply the heat and energy
when the fats and carbohydrates daily consumed are
not sufficient for the day’s demands. This is the
principle in reduction of flesh.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that habits of combining foods
are, perhaps unconsciously, based on dietetic principles.</p>

<p>Meats, rich in protein, are served with potatoes
or with rice, both of which are rich in starch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Bread, containing little fat, is served with butter.</p>

<p>Beans, containing little fat, are cooked with pork.</p>

<p>Starchy foods of all kinds are served with butter
or cream.</p>

<p>Macaroni, which is rich in starch, makes a well-balanced
food when served with cheese.</p>

<p>Pork and beans, bread and butter, bread and milk,
chicken and rice, macaroni and cheese, poached eggs
on toast, and custards, form balanced foods.</p>

<p>A knowledge of such combinations is important
when one must eat a hasty luncheon and wishes to
supply the demands of the body in the least time,
giving the least thought to the selection; but hasty
luncheons, with the mind concentrated on other
things, are to be strongly condemned.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that the average daily need
of the adult is forty-five ounces of solid food, one-fourth
animal and three-fourths vegetable. Twice
as much water as solids should be taken.</p>

<p>The laborer, engaged in heavy muscular activity,
needs and can assimilate more than the sedentary office
worker. Those who work but a few hours a day require
less food, as a rule, than those who work long hours.</p>

<p>Cold weather demands more heat-producing foods;
a hot climate, inducing inactivity of body, diminishes
the need for food.</p>

<p>The invalid needs less food than the healthy.</p>

<p>The inhabitant of the frigid zone needs much fat;
he who lives in the tropics but little fat.</p>

<p>The old need less food than the growing youth or
the hearty adult.</p>

<p>The poor must often take what he can get while
the rich eat to satiety. Yet all these food needs vary
with the individual and with the sex and activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>It has been computed that the system needs daily
three hundred grains of nitrogen and four thousand eight
hundred grains of carbon. To obtain this amount of
nitrogen if bread alone were eaten it would require four
pounds of bread from the whole wheat. The carbon in
this amount of bread largely exceeds that required. If
eaten alone, six pounds of beef would be necessary to
supply the proper amount of carbon, and twenty-three
pounds of eggs. The nitrogen in this amount would
far exceed the requirement.</p>

<p>One pint of milk, 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> ounces of bread, and six
ounces of beef are about equal in nutritive value.</p>

<p>One can see, therefore, why a diet composed of too
great a quantity of one substance gives an overbalance
of one and an underbalance of another.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is more economical to use some fat
and sugar in the diet and less meat. More vegetables,
perhaps, and more fluid should be taken by many.</p>

<p>Authorities vary in their estimates of the amount
of food required by the individual. It varies with
the activity, the season, the age, the sex, and it varies
in the same individual on different days.</p>

<p>Billings estimates that the daily diet of a healthy,
hard-working man should contain: 20 ounces (1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>
pounds) of lean meat; 22 ounces, about 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> pounds or
1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> loaves of baker’s bread; 10 ounces or about 4
medium sized potatoes; and several glasses of fluid.
Since the fluid should be twice the amount of solids,
this would mean about 12 glasses.</p>

<p>Others compute that the amount of food weighed
dry, needed by the average person of sedentary habits,
is as follows: For breakfast, 8 ounces; for luncheon,
6 ounces; for dinner, 9 ounces, with 48 ounces or 3
glasses of water. These two give extremes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>In active persons from 3 to 3<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> ounces (about one-fourth
of a pound) of nitrogenous food will replace
the nitrogen lost from the body. One ounce (1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> of
the ordinary brick) of butter a day supplies the necessary
fat, and about 15 to 20 ounces (1 to 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> pounds)
of carbohydrate are required.</p>

<p>According to Thompson, from two to three pints
of urine are excreted each day; ten ounces of water are
lost by the lungs, and eighteen ounces are evaporated
from the skin. This amount, about eighty ounces or
ten glasses, must be replaced daily to maintain the
body in its equilibrium of supply and demand. A
part of this is supplied in the food.</p>

<p>These figures may be altered somewhat according
to the individual or the climate as previously mentioned,
but they constitute a fair average.</p>

<p>Dr. W. S. Hall estimates that the average man at
light work requires,</p>

<p>A medium-sized man at out-of-door work, fully
oxidizes all waste of the system and he requires a
higher protein diet—125 grams. In such event he does
not require so much starch and sugar. If, on the
other hand, he were to take but 106.8 grams of protein,
as above, he would require more carbohydrates.
One working or exercising in the fresh air breathes
more deeply and oxidizes and eliminates more waste,
hence he has a better appetite, which is simply the
call of nature for replacing the waste.</p>

<p>Experiments in the quantity of food actually required
for body needs, made by Prof. R. H. Chittenden,
of the Sheffield Scientific School, Yale University,
have established, beyond doubt, the fact that the
average individual consumes very much more food
than the system requires. In fact, most tables of food
requirements, in books on dietetics, are heavy, yet
the amount of food required as a result of Professor
Chittenden’s experiments would seem to be too light
for a continuous diet.</p>

<p>Professor Chittenden especially established the
fact that the average person consumes more protein
than is necessary to maintain a nitrogenous balance.
It was formerly held that the average daily metabolism
and excretion of nitrogen through the kidneys
was sixteen grams, or proportionate to about one
hundred grams of protein or albuminoid food.</p>

<p>Professor Chittenden’s tests, covering a period of
six months, shows an average daily excretion of
5.86 grams of nitrogen, or a little less than one-third
of that formerly accepted as necessary; 5.86 grams
of nitrogen corresponds to 36.62 grams of protein or
albuminoid food.</p>

<p>Professor Chittenden’s experiments concerning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
amount of foodstuffs actually required by three groups
of men, one group of United States soldiers, a group
from the Yale College athletic team, and a group of
college professors, all showed that the men retained
full strength, with a higher degree of physical and
mental efficiency, when the body was not supplied
with more protein than was liberated by metabolic
activity, and when the quantity of carbonaceous food
was regulated to the actual requirements for body
heat and energy.</p>

<p>It may be well to call attention here to the fact
that most of the food elements, called on for work,
are not derived from those foods just consumed or
digested, but from those eaten a day or two previous,
which have been assimilated in the muscular tissues.</p>

<p>A wise provision of Nature enables the body to
throw off an excess of food above its needs without
injury, within limitations; but, as stated, there is no
doubt that the average person exceeds these limits,
exhausting the digestive organs and loading the
system with more than it can eliminate; the capacity
for mental work becomes restricted, and the whole system
suffers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Mixed Diet
versus a
Vegetarian
Diet</div>

<p>From the fact that only from two to four
ounces of nitrogenous food are required to
rebuild daily tissue waste, it is apparent that
this amount can readily be supplied from
the vegetable kingdom, since nuts, legumes,
and cereals are rich in proteins; yet there is a question
whether a purely vegetable diet is productive of the
highest physical and mental development. Natives
of tropical climates live on vegetables, fruits, and
nuts, and it may be purely accidental, or be due to
climatic or other conditions, that these nations have
not made the greatest progress. Neither have the
Eskimos, who live almost entirely on meat, attained
the highest development.</p>

<p>The greatest progress and development, both as
nations and as individuals, have been made by inhabitants
of temperate climates, who have lived on a
mixed diet of meat, eggs, milk, grains, vegetables,
fruits, and nuts. They have shown more creative
force, which means reserve strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>The Eskimo has demonstrated, however, that a
diet of meat alone supplies all physical needs; the
meat tissue providing growth and repair and the fat
supplying all of the carbonaceous elements. The
fat, as previously stated, yields more heat than
starches and sugars, and Nature provides this heat for
climates in which most warmth is required. This
may be the reason why natives of warm climates
have formed the habit of using vegetables and grains
for their heat and energy rather than meat. It is
also the natural reason why man in temperate climates
eats more meat in winter than in summer.</p>

<p>An unperverted, natural instinct will always be
found to have a sound physiological basis. For example,
if, by reason of some digestive disturbance,
one has become emaciated, all of the fat having been
consumed, and the cause of the disturbance is removed
by an operation or otherwise, one is seized with an
almost insatiable desire for fat, often eating large
chunks of the fat of meat or large quantities of butter
or cream at a meal. When obstructions are removed,
Nature makes immediate effort to readjust her
forces.</p>

<p>Those who object to eating meat should study carefully
to learn if the proper proportion of protein is
supplied with each day’s rations. The legumes—peas,
beans, nuts, and grains—must be supplied.
While the wheat kernel contains twelve per cent.
of protein, the white flour does not contain as large
a percentage and it will be noted by reference to
Tables II and III, that the majority of fruits and
vegetables contain little nitrogenous substance.</p>

<p>Unless the whole of the grain and the legumes form
a goodly proportion of the diet the danger is in consuming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
too large a bulk of waste and too much starch
in a purely vegetable diet.</p>

<p>In a vegetarian diet, one is liable to eat too freely
of cereals; as a result, the liver becomes clogged and
torpid and the stomach and intestines are deranged
and rendered incapable of full digestion and absorption.
The clogged system refuses to assimilate more
food.</p>

<p><em>It follows, therefore, that, unless one is a thorough
student of dietetics, the mixed diet is by far the safest
to follow.</em></p>

<p>One can better run short of starch or fat in one
day’s rations than to be short of protein, because if the
two or four ounces daily requirement is not provided
the tissues are consumed and the blood is impoverished.
It is a rare condition in which a reserve of
glycogen and fat is not stored in the system. On the
other hand, an excess of nitrogenous foods calls for a
very active circulation and plenty of oxygen in the
system.</p>

<p>It has been held that the vegetarian has a clearer
brain, and, if this be true, it may be due to the fact
that he is not eating too much and thus his system is
not overloaded.</p>

<p>Experience, however, does not prove that he has
greater mental, physical, and moral power and efficiency.</p>

<p>In fasting, likewise, the mental power is at first
clear and forceful, but the reason becomes unbalanced
if the fast be too prolonged.</p>

<p><em>A complete diet may be selected without animal flesh,
but including animal products of eggs, milk, cream, and
butter, together with vegetables, fruits, cereals, and nuts,
yet, if the vegetable diet be selected, the legumes, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
whole of the grains, and nuts, must be given their share
in each day’s rations.</em></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Diet when
Traveling</div>

<p>Each year sees an increase in the number
of travelers. The question of diet many
times is of great importance. For those of
abundant means the question is simplified, oftentimes,
by the railway dining-car service, but for those who
from economic reasons must patronize the wayside
railway restaurants or other eating places, the diet
question is not so easily solved.</p>

<p>A carefully planned lunch-box is often an aid to
the preservation of regular habits and a preventative
of digestive disturbances, due to a sudden and radical
change of diet.</p>

<p>The inactivity and sedentary habit enforced by a
long journey, in which there is small chance for exercise,
generally causes constipation. The shaking of
the boat or train also aids this, as it interrupts normal
peristalsis. The motion of the boat or train often
produces nausea and vomiting and thus deranges the
digestive organs.</p>

<p>Greasy or illy prepared food hastily eaten at a
lunch counter provokes various gastric and intestinal
ills.</p>

<p>The danger of infected or polluted water complicates
the problem, especially when the sick or infants are
involved. Many an attack of typhoid fever has
been traced to the drinking water used during a
vacation trip.</p>

<p>The invention of the vacuum bottle has solved one
need of the traveler. The invention of the electric
heater has solved another.</p>

<p>Sterilized and cooled milk may be carried by means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
of the vacuum bottle for use with children or the sick,
and the portable stove will enable the boiling and
sterilizing of water, when a larger supply is needed
than can be carried in a vacuum bottle. By its means,
also, a hot drink can be prepared for the aged, the
invalid, or other individual, when necessary, as in an
emergency.</p>

<p>All fried and greasy food and unripe fruits should
be avoided.</p>

<p>One had better lessen the amount of food than
suffer the gastric difficulties occasioned by too much
fatty food.</p>

<p>Hard whole wheat crackers with fruit and milk can
be had at almost any eating house. These give a
well-balanced meal and are often preferable to prepared
dishes. Fresh fruit, especially the acid fruits,
should form a large part of the diet.</p>

<p>The traveler, on extended journeys, should always
provide some of the easily carried condensed foods,
so that if the food obtained by the way is unpalatable
or illy prepared, or in case food is unobtainable, the
needs of the system may be met. Beef meal, whole
wheat or oatmeal crackers, malted milk, chocolate,
meat extracts, etc., occupy little space and may often
prove invaluable.</p>

<p>Tablets of soda and also of lime are easily carried
and may be used when soda water or lime water is
needed as in nausea or indigestion.</p>

<p>If it is possible, the water drunk while traveling
should be boiled.</p>

<p>The bowels must be kept active and fresh fruits
and water are the best aids in accomplishing this.</p>

<p>The remedies recommended for car sickness or seasickness
are legion; what is an aid in one case is almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
or quite without avail in another. Lemon juice
or a slice of lemon in the mouth is generally of most
avail, though lime water in some cases has proven of
service. Attacks can often be mitigated or avoided
by not starting on a journey when overtired, by light
eating for several days previous to beginning a journey,
with care in securing good elimination and plenty of
fresh air.</p>

<p>If traveling by boat a reclining chair on deck is far
preferable to lying in a berth in a stuffy stateroom.</p>

<p>Nausea can often be prevented or remedied by deep
breathing or by the sipping of hot water with a little
soda.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><em><span class="upper-case">Before</span> giving any diets, let me first of all impress
the importance of eating slowly, of good cheer, of
light conversation during a meal, and of thoroughly
masticating the food. Remember it is the food assimilated
which nourishes.</em></p>

<p>The following diets allow sufficient food for average
conditions, when the vital organs are normal.</p>

<p>Fruit, as previously stated, contains a very small
quantity of nutrition. It is more valuable for its
diuretic effect, and to stimulate the appetite; for this
reason it may well be eaten before a meal.</p>

<p>The citrus fruits tend to neutralize too high acidity
of the blood, increasing its alkalinity. For this reason,
also, they are best before a meal, particularly before
breakfast; they have a more laxative and cleansing
effect if eaten before the other food. The custom
has been, however, to eat fruits after dinner for dessert
and they are so given in the following menus.</p>

<p>Table XI (page <a href="#Page_207">207</a>) gives the total amount of protein,
carbohydrate, and fat needed daily for the work
of the body. The method of determining the number
of calories produced by each variety of food is also
given on page <a href="#Page_208">208</a>.</p>

<p>By a little study of the food one ordinarily eats in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
connection with this tabulation and the tables given
on pages <a href="#Page_233">233</a> to <a href="#Page_241">241</a>, it can be determined whether the
food taken each day is well or illy balanced and
whether one is eating too much or not enough.</p>

<p>Table XIII (page <a href="#Page_209">209</a>) gives the balanced supply
for a day of the most commonly used foods and may
be consulted as a basis from which to work in constructing
balanced meals.</p>

<p>Because of the wide variation in methods of preparing
food in the home, an exact and absolute standard
cannot be fixed.</p>

<p>All foods contain combinations of mineral salts,
particularly calcium (lime), sodium, magnesium, and
potassium. In each food, however, some mineral
predominates. For instance, potatoes contain both
calcium and potassium but the potassium content is
larger than the calcium. For this reason when potassium
salts are needed in a diet, potatoes and other
potassium-containing foods make a valuable contribution.
When potassium needs to be limited these
foods should be omitted from the diet. When calcium
is needed, as in growing children, calcium-containing
foods should be made a large part of the
diet.</p>

<p>In conditions of health the construction of a balanced
diet is a comparatively simple matter. In conditions
of disease, however, the question of diet is
often one that can only be solved by a skilled dietitian,
after a chemical analysis. Unfortunately, the number
of these in the United States is not large and their
services are not available in many cases in which
they are needed.</p>

<p>A diet in which the acid-forming elements are in
excess will ultimately result in a lessening of the alkalinity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
of the blood. The blood then, to maintain its
balance, withdraws alkaline substances from the
tissues. A balance must, therefore, be maintained
between the acid and alkaline foods. This has a
bearing on scurvy and also in gout.</p>

<p>Foods which are called acid, that is, they tend to
lessen the normal alkalinity of the blood, are, oats,
barley, beef, wheat, eggs, rice, and maize. When the
proportion of acid in the blood is too great the supply
of these foods should be lessened.</p>

<p>Alkaline foods, or those which leave no acid residue,
are carrots, turnips, potatoes, onions, milk, blood,
peas, lemon and orange juice, and beans. These
may be used when there is too much acid in the
system.</p>

<p>Neutral foods are sugar, the vegetable oils, and
animal fats.</p>

<p>All the content of the foods must be taken into
consideration in building a diet, the carbohydrate, fat,
and protein being considered as well as the mineral.
A consideration of the mineral content, however,
should not be neglected. One-eighth grain of iron
is taken daily in the ordinary mixed diet. The fact
that in one quart of milk, according to Hutchinson,
there are <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> grains of calcium shows how valuable
this food is to the growing child for bone and tissue
building. It must also be considered when constipation
results from a milk diet. Milk and its
derivatives are poor in iron, while meat, fish, potatoes,
fruits, and bread are poor in calcium. Animal
foods are rich in sodium; vegetables and fruits in
potassium.</p>

<p>The following shows the foods which contain
mineral salts, in larger proportions.</p>

<p>In the following menus the effort has been to give
a correct balance of the various food elements with
the approximate calories furnished by each meal.
They are suggestive only and may be varied according
to the season of the year, the habits of work, or the
tastes of the individual, care being taken to preserve
the relative proportions.</p>

<p>For instance, if much starch or fat is taken at a
meal and little protein, the balance should swing in
the other direction for another meal, the amount of
protein being increased and that of carbohydrate
decreased.</p>

<p>Common sense must rule in the matter, as one individual
would be illy fed on a diet which would be
entirely adequate for another of more sedentary habit
and weaker digestion. All the habits of life such as
exercise, breathing, and mental activity must be taken
into consideration.</p>

<p>As previously remarked, there must be a variety
in the diet which will stimulate the appetite, and,
unless the tastes of the various members of a family
are capricious, they may be gratified.</p>

<p>If potatoes are not relished rice may be substituted.</p>

<p>Plain bread may be varied by rolls or biscuits.</p>

<p>Well-masticated nuts may supply the protein
usually served in meat and are often a welcome
change.</p>

<p>The protein balance is important as this substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
is the basis for growth and repair of the tissues of the
body.</p>

<p>When the protein balance of the family meal is
provided by meat, if for any reason one member of
the family does not care for meat, the protein may be
supplied by eggs, or by the legumes as shown on
pages <a href="#Page_232">232-234</a>.</p>

<p><em>Let me repeat that everyone should watch his likes
and dislikes in the matter of food and guard against
allowing himself to become finicky; he should not cultivate
a dislike for a food which may disagree with him at a
certain time or the taste of which he does not like, if that
food is wholesome.</em></p>

<p>Remember that the likes and dislikes for food are
largely matters of cultivation and one misses much
enjoyment and much of health which comes from a
well-nourished body by habitually sitting down to a
table in a pessimistic frame of mind because the food
served does not suit the fancy.</p>

<p>It is very difficult for a mother to provide a meal
which suits each member of her family and consideration
for her as well as for self should teach one to
guard against a critical attitude.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a badly balanced
menu. It was given a family, including a child, by
a mother who “had no time to study foods. She
gave her folks what was the easiest to get and filled
them up the quickest.” This mother may have wasted
hours in gossip with the neighbors, or on “fancy
work.”</p>

<p>The cardinal sin of such a diet is in the lack of
protein, the great predominance of starch, and the
inadequate supply of fat. An excessive amount of
sugar, however, was taken in the tea. This was taken
to satisfy the taste, not realizing that the system
demanded it for energy.</p>

<p>The child was given one egg and one slice of bread
for breakfast. Being a light eater it asked for no
more, but her mother wondered why the child was so
pale and suffered from constipation.</p>

<p>No water was given with any meal.</p>

<p><em>There are thousands of such illy nourished children
in our schools, lacking in brain power and readily
subject to infection, because of badly combined or poorly
prepared food.</em></p>

<p>The number of calories in such a diet may suffice to
sustain life, but the balance is insufficient, the amount
inadequate, the tissues are not repaired, the secretions
lack some of their necessary ingredients or are scanty,
and the functions of the body are not well performed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Sedentary
Occupation</div>

<p>The following diet is for one who has
attained full growth and who exercises no
more than to walk a few blocks a day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
The diet may seem light, but when one is sitting indoor
most of the time, and has little outdoor exercise,
less waste protein is oxidized and less starch, fat, and
sugar are required for heat and energy. If too much
carbonaceous food is consumed, one will store up too
much and become too large. If more protein is consumed
than is oxidized and eliminated one is liable
to various derangements of the system.</p>

<p>Every person at sedentary employment should
exercise each day without fail, being particular to
bring a thorough circulation to the vital organs. He
should fully inflate his lungs many times a day and
see to it that the air in the room is pure.</p>

<p>In nearly all of the following menus coffee and tea
have been omitted because, as before stated, they
are not foods but <em>stimulants</em>, and the caffein and thein
may overstimulate the nerves and the heart. They
sometimes retard digestion. Some other warm drink
should be substituted when there is digestive disturbance,
or when the digestion is weak. They
should never at any time be used strong. They
are used simply for their pleasing flavor, or for
warmth.</p>

<p>The following diet is suggested for one of sedentary
habit who is not exercising and does not use up
much mental or physical energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>If one has taken brisk exercise, or is to take a brisk

</p>

<p>If purée of peas or beans is used the sandwich may be omitted
and one slice of bread is sufficient. If the soup contains much
cream or is made of corn or potato, the cake or cookies may be
omitted.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><em>Dinner</em></p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">

<div class="sidenotel">For the Girl
or Boy from
13 to 21</div>

<p>There is no time in life when one needs
to be so watchful of the diet as during these
years. Growth is very rapid and much
protein is needed to build tissue, particularly
to build the red blood corpuscles. Anemia may
be produced by a faulty diet or by one which lacks
eggs, meat, fresh vegetables or fruit, particularly in
developing girls.</p>

<p>The red meats, the yolk of eggs, spinach and all
kinds of greens are important articles of diet at this
time, because of the iron which they contain. They
should be supplied freely. Butter and milk are valuable
and <em>regular exercises with deep breathing are
imperative</em>.</p>

<p>If the appetite wanes, be sure that the girl or boy
is getting sufficient brisk exercise in the fresh air.</p>


<p class="center no-indent fs90">DIET IV</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><em>Breakfast</em></p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">
Fruit<br>
Oatmeal, shredded wheat biscuit or triscuit, or some other well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>cooked cereal with cream and sugar<br>
One egg, boiled or poached (cooked soft), or chipped beef in cream gravy<br>
Cereal coffee, toast coffee, or hot water with cream and sugar<br>
Buttered toast, gems, or muffins<br>
</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><em>Luncheon</em></p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">
Cream soup, bean soup, or purée with crackers or dry toast<br>
Bread and butter<br>
Fruit and cake, or rice pudding, or bread, tapioca, cocoanut, or
cereal pudding of any kind, or a cup of custard, or a dish
of ice cream<br>
</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><em>Dinner</em></p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">
Meat (preferably red meat)<br>
Potatoes<br>
Vegetables, preferably spinach, or greens of some kind, or beets boiled with the tops<br>
Graham bread<br>
Fruit, graham bread toasted or graham wafers. Cake of some simple variety.<br>

</p>
<br>

<p>A growing child is usually hungry when it returns
from school, and it is well to give a little easily digested
food regularly at this time, but not sufficient to destroy
the appetite for the evening meal. Irregular eating
between meals, however, should be discouraged. An
egg lemonade is easily digested and satisfying. If
active and exercising freely, craving for sweets should
be gratified to a limited extent.</p>

<p>The growing boy or girl takes from six to eight
glasses of water a day.</p>

<p>Overeating, however, should be guarded against
for many of the dietary habits of adult life are formed
in this period, and the foundation of many dietetic
difficulties and disturbances of the system are laid.</p>

<p>If one is not hungry at meal time, the chances are
that he is not exercising sufficiently in the fresh air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p><em>Thorough mastication should be insisted on.</em></p>

<p>One should encourage the habit of eating hard
crusts or hard crackers to exercise the teeth and to
insure the swallowing of sufficient saliva.</p>

<p>The schoolboy or schoolgirl, anxious to be out at
play, is especially liable to bolt the food or to eat an
insufficient amount. This should be especially guarded
against and parents should insist on the proper time
being spent at meals.</p>

<p>The dislike for meat or for certain vegetables or
articles of food, which develops in this period, should
be guarded against. All wholesome food should be
made a part of the diet and the child should not be
indulged in its likes or dislikes, but should be instructed
in overcoming these.</p>

<p>Very few foods disagree at all times with a normal
child and if they do the cause usually lies in a disordered
digestion which needs to be restored by more
careful attention to exercise, deep breathing, and to
elimination of the waste of the system.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">The
Athlete</div>

<p>The young man active in athletics needs
practically the same food as given in Diet
IV, yet more in quantity. He needs to
drink water before his training and at rest periods
during the game.</p>

<p>If he is too fat, he should train off the superfluous
amount by exercise and by judiciously abstaining
from much sugars, starches, and fats.</p>

<p>Diets for reduction, however, must be governed
by the condition of the kidneys and the digestive
organs.</p>

<p>Deep breathing habits are imperative though he
must be careful not to overtax lungs or heart by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
hard continuous straining, either at breathing or at
exercise.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Laboring
Man</div>

<p>The man engaged in muscular work
requires plenty of food; he can digest
foods which the professional or business
man, or the man of sedentary habits, cannot. He will
probably be able to drink coffee and tea without any
disturbance to nerves or to digestion. In his muscular
work he liberates the waste freely and needs fats,
starches, and sugars to supply the heat and energy.
This is especially true of men who work in the fresh
air; the muscular action liberates waste and heat and
the full breathing freely oxidizes the waste, putting
it in condition to be excreted through lungs, skin,
kidneys, and intestines.</p>

<p>He should have more meat, eggs, and nitrogenous
foods, and he also needs more carbonaceous foods to
supply heat and energy, as given in Diet V. Three
hearty meals a day are necessary.</p>

<p>His muscular movements keep the circulation forceful
and the vital organs strong so that his diet may
be almost as heavy as that of the football player.
Meat or eggs, twice a day, with tea or coffee, and
even <em>pie</em> may be eaten with impunity. He needs a
good nourishing breakfast of bacon and eggs or meat,
also potatoes, or a liberal allowance of bread and
butter, corn bread, muffins, etc.</p>

Stewed fruit<br>
Tea<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>These individuals need little meat. Tea, if used,
should not be strong and, for reasons given on page
104, should never be allowed to steep.</p>

<p>If the habit of life is active, if one exercises regularly,
and if the constitution is vigorous and the body not
too encumbered with fat, a greater variety and amount
of food may be allowed, but great regularity should
be observed concerning the diet and the hours for
meals. Thorough mastication is more than ever a
necessity.</p>

<p>If inclined to constipation, or if the kidneys are
inactive, grapes or an apple, or some fruit, well
chewed, may be eaten just before retiring.</p>

<p>Careful attention must be given to securing thorough
removal of waste by attention to the eliminative
organs, not overloading them.</p>

<p>The following tables<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> are exceptionally valuable in
compiling diets in various combinations. One can
readily determine the number of grams in various servings
of different foods. For example: a small serving
of beef (round), containing some fat, weighs 36 grams;
40 per cent., 14.4 grams, is protein, and 60 per cent.,
21.6 grams, is fat (no carbohydrates). One ordinary
thick slice of white, home-made bread weighs 38
grams; 13 per cent., 4.94 grams, is protein; 6 per cent.,
2.28 grams, is fat, and 81 per cent., 30.78 grams, is
carbohydrate.</p>

<p>The proportion of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats
required by the average individual as suggested on
page <a href="#Page_208">208</a> can be readily made up from various combinations
of foods. Each individual may ascertain
whether he is taking too much food, or too large a
proportion of proteins or of carbohydrates or fats.</p>

<span class="fs80">DIET IN ABNORMAL CONDITIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the dietetic treatment of any disordered organ,
the object must be to give that organ as much rest
from its regular work as is consistent with keeping
up the general nutrition of the system. The stomach
and intestines and liver are so closely allied that, when
one is affected, the others are liable to affection also,
and the dietetic treatment is regulated accordingly.</p>

<p>In abnormal conditions it is necessary to say that
the food must be regulated according to the case.
Yet, broadly speaking, a diet largely of protein, which
is digested in the stomach, rests the intestines and
stimulates the liver, and a diet largely of carbohydrates
rests the stomach, because the gastric juice is
not active in starch digestion.</p>

<p>When the body is not in normal condition, because
certain elements are lacking in the blood, these elements
must be supplied in larger proportions in the
food, and the case is one for a food chemist, or for
one who has made food conditions a study.</p>

<p>The better medical colleges, recognizing the importance
of proper food in health and disease, have
in the last few years broadened their curriculum to
include the subject of dietetics. Educated physical
culturists and food specialists, for the correction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
deranged conditions of the system, due to poor circulation
and abnormal nerve and blood conditions, are
doing much of the corrective work, due to the fact
that instruction has not been given in the medical
colleges.</p>

<p>Diets for the reduction of an abnormal amount of
fat must also be governed according to the individual
condition.</p>

<p>In the early stages of various diseases, when toxins
are being produced, as a rule the system is not properly
eliminating the waste, and it is often advisable
to abstain from food for from one to three days,
according to conditions. Brisk exercise, deep breathing,
and a free use of water are desirable. A laxative
is often recommended.</p>

<p>The diets given here for abnormal conditions are
to enable those in charge of an invalid to gain an
intelligent understanding of the needs of the system
and to supply those needs through the proper foods.
In serious cases, however, special diets will be ordered
by the medical attendant to suit the needs of the
individual.</p>

<p>A chemical analysis of the blood and the excretions
is often the only method of determining just the diet
in the individual case.</p>

<p>Government chemical laboratories in charge of
efficient chemists should be so located as to be accessible
to every physician.</p>

<p>The system readily excretes an excess of vegetable
products, and, as a rule, no acute difficulties result
from such an excess. Such chronic difficulties as
constipation, torpid liver, and indigestion, however,
frequently result when an excess of starch is taken
above that consumed in energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>On account of the readiness with which putrefaction
occurs in protein products, care should be taken
not to consume these in too great proportion.</p>

<p>A study of the physical ailments of thousands of
women has shown, by the constituents in the blood
and the condition of the different organs of the digestive
system, the habitual taste for foods. One can
usually determine which food the individual has formed
a habit of eating, because the system will show a lack
of the elements which that patient has denied herself
on account of her likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>It is necessary to change the mental attitude toward
certain foods before the system will readily assimilate
them; thus, as stated, <em>a taste for foods which the body
requires should be cultivated</em>.</p>

<p>Every mother, with growing children, should be a
thorough student of the chemistry of food. If the
child’s bones do not increase sufficiently in size and
strength after the second year, care in the selection of
foods rich in protein and phosphates of lime and magnesium
may correct it. Such a child should have scraped
meat and whole wheat bread with milk and eggs.</p>

<p>If the child stores up too much fat, increase the
amount of exercise and of oxygen consumed, and
either cut down the proportion of sweets and starches
or decrease the quantity of food and require more
thorough mastication.</p>

<p>If one is thin and undernourished, chemical analysis
of the contents of the stomach, intestines, and urine
is sometimes desirable. The nerves should be
relaxed, and proper food, exercise, and breathing
should accompany medical treatment, if medicine
is needed. Often an entire change in thought and
diet are helpful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes a torpid condition of the liver and sluggish
activity of the intestines are indicated. Special
exercises to stimulate this activity and to encourage
correct poise and deep breathing are most essential.
The mind must often be stimulated and an interest
be awakened, directing the thoughts in new channels.</p>

<p>Worry and tensity of thought are among the chief
causes in the majority of cases of lack of flesh and of
a very large number of blood and digestive disorders.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Anemia</div>

<p>In anemia there is either a decrease in
the number of red blood corpuscles or an
insufficient amount of blood. When there are too
few red blood corpuscles, “oxygen carriers,” the necessary
quantity of oxygen is not furnished the tissues
and the system becomes clogged with waste. The
patient easily tires and is disinclined to exercise, thus
the decreased number of red corpuscles are not kept
in forceful circulation and the carbon dioxid is not
freely thrown off by the lungs; this further aggravates
the condition.</p>

<p>Since the blood is made from the foods assimilated,
the point is to supply food which builds blood tissue.
Exercise and deep breathing will encourage the elimination
of waste and promote a forceful circulation
which insures nourishment to the tissues. As stated,
it is the food assimilated, not always the amount
eaten, that counts.</p>

<p>In this condition it is of vital importance that one
keep up a good circulation; the stomach, intestines,
liver, and spleen must be strengthened through exercise
and deep breathing of pure air, for the red blood
corpuscles are oxygen carriers, and the insufficient
supply must do double duty or the waste of the system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
will not be oxidized and eliminated, and the blood-forming
organs will further fail in their task.</p>

<p>Exercise must be graded to the case, being gentle
at first so as not to overtire the easily fatigued muscular
system. It should be intelligently directed to
the joints and to the vital organs, particularly to the
liver and intestines, that they may be kept in normal
activity. The exercises must be followed with plenty
of rest, and accompanied by deep breathing. The
habit of full breathing is one of the most effective
agencies in correction of anemia, because the red
blood corpuscles must carry their full quota of oxygen
or the system is clogged with waste. Oxygen also
rejuvenates these corpuscles.</p>

<p>Unless the blood furnished to the tissues is of good
quality and contains sufficient oxygen, the nutrition
of the body suffers, the activity of the various organs
is hindered, and the health becomes impaired. Functional
derangements, particularly in the digestive
tract follow, and faulty digestion and difficult absorption
further impoverish the blood.</p>

<p>The work, therefore, in the correction of anemia,
lies in foods which build blood and in daily exercise
and deep breathing of fresh air, accompanied by rest.</p>

<p>The windows at night should admit a good circulation
of air through the sleeping room, and as much
time as possible should be spent in the open air.</p>

<p>Anemia occurs many times in growing girls, due to
an improperly balanced diet, caused by a capricious
appetite and by the habit of satisfying this appetite
with sweets, pickles, etc.</p>

<p>The body, during growth, needs increased nutritive
material, not only to replace the waste, but also to
meet the demands for new building material for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
various organs, particularly the brain and the nervous
system. Overwork either in school or in industrial
occupations, the hasty eating of meals, or insufficient
amounts of food, also aid in reducing both the quantity
and quality of the blood.</p>

<p>Worry is one chief cause of anemia.</p>

<p>Insufficient sleep, due to late hours, further increases
the tension of the nerves and lowers the
vitality, causing depression which interferes with
digestion.</p>

<p>When the red blood corpuscles are decreased the
oxidation of the fats is interfered with, because oxygen
is necessary to burn the fat. The non-use of the
fatty material causes it to be stored in the tissues
so that the body often appears well nourished and
plump. The muscles, however, are flabby and weak
and usually the pallor of the skin shows the lack of
coloring matter in the blood.</p>

<p>The digestive organs are often weak. They must
not be overloaded or the very object of the extra
feeding will be defeated. In such cases the food must
be taken in less quantity and more frequently. Also
a diet rich in albumin and iron must be supplied.</p>

<p>It will often be found that one whose blood is lacking
in hemoglobin and in the proper proportion of red
blood corpuscles has had a dislike for the foods rich
in iron, or perhaps through poverty, or some other
cause, has not been able to get the right kind of
food.</p>

<p>The yolks of eggs, the red meats (such as steak,
mutton, or the breast of wild game) and the deeply
colored greens (such as spinach, chard, dandelions,
etc.) contain a goodly proportion of iron. The dark
leaves of lettuce, celery, and cabbage contain iron;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
these vegetables are apt to be bleached before being
marketed.</p>

<p>It is better, in anemia, to take the yolks of two eggs
than one whole egg, as the iron is in the yolk. A good
way to take the yolks of eggs is in egg lemonade or
in eggnog, with a little flavoring.</p>

<p>Anemia sufferers have usually formed the habit
of eating starches and sweets. It will usually be
found that they have no desire for vegetables
containing iron, or for meats rich in albuminoids,
and this habit is shown in the blood composition.
They often eat the white of the egg and discard
the yolk, rich in iron. Tact and persuasion will
often be necessary to induce them to take the proper
foods.</p>

<p>If constipation is present, whole wheat bread, oatmeal,
stewed prunes, grapes, stewed or baked apples,
and oranges, should be taken freely.</p>

<p>When the anemic individual is thin, he should take
as much fat food as the system will assimilate. Bacon
is well digested and palatable. Fat may be taken in
milk, cream, and butter.</p>

<p>The food must be made attractive to tempt the
appetite, which is usually poor, and within reason
one should be allowed any wholesome food which he
desires. Condiments often stimulate the stomach
and intestines to better action.</p>

<p>Vinegars, because of their action on the blood,
should not be allowed nor rich pastries and sauces.</p>

<p>Beef may be scraped and made into sandwiches
or used in purées and meat broth, which may also
have a beaten egg in it.</p>

<p>When appetite is persistently absent, attention
should be paid to the eliminative organs in order to
remove all clogging of the system by retained waste.</p>

<p>If the stomach and intestines are prolapsed as a
result of improper nourishment and resultant weak
tissues, rest in bed, with special exercises which will
replace the organs and strengthen the supporting
tissues, is required.</p>


<h3><em>STOMACH DISORDERS</em></h3>

<p>Most chronic cases are due to worry; to improper
hygiene, such as irregular meals; fat and greasy foods;
hasty eating; too much sweets; insufficient mastication,
with resulting lack of saliva; wrong choice of
foods; too frequent eating, giving the stomach no
rest; too large an amount of food; too highly spiced
foods; coffee or tea; a general run-down condition,
with a weakness of muscles of the stomach, due to
insufficient blood supply; to a weakened or over-strained
condition of nerves controlling the stomach;
and usually to insufficient exercise and fresh air.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Indigestion
or
Dyspepsia</div>

<p>Indigestion or dyspepsia is the broad
term commonly applied to most chronic
stomach and intestinal difficulties, due, not
alone to structural disease or to displacements,
but also to their inability to perform their
normal functions. The term includes troubles arising
from so many different causes that in each case the
cause must be determined and remedied before definite
results can be attained through diet.</p>

<p>The most usual is that the gastric glands are pouring
out an insufficient amount of secretion; almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
always there is a deficiency of hydrochloric acid.
In some cases in which the food has irritated and
inflamed the stomach there may be a sufficient secretion
of this acid, but an inflamed stomach throws off
more mucus and the extra quantity of mucus neutralizes
the hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>When the acid is deficient or absent, the proteins
are not well digested and the food may ferment;
bacteria may produce putrefactive changes and the
formation of gas. The gas interferes with the movement
of the diaphragm, pressing it against the heart,
causing pain and even palpitation.</p>

<p>Indigestion is usually accompanied by constipation,
or by irregular action of the intestines.</p>

<p>Plenty of fresh air, and exercise, directed definitely
to muscles and nerves of the stomach, that it may be
strengthened by a better blood supply, as well as
exercises and deep breathing to build up the general
health, should be systematically followed.</p>

<p>Easily digested food, well masticated, and regular
meals served daintily, will gradually regulate digestion.</p>

<p>Food should not be of too great a variety at one
meal. It must be simple and well prepared; when
nerves and muscles are weak it should be served less
in quantity but more frequently. Sometimes light
food every hour or every two hours is best.</p>

<p>Cheerful constructive thoughts are the very best
of medicine for digestive derangements.</p>

<p>A glass of cold water from one-half to an hour before
the meal will cleanse the stomach by washing out the
mucus and will promote the secretion of saliva and
the gastric juices.</p>

<p>The intelligent medical treatment of stomach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
difficulties is aided by a chemical analysis of the
stomach contents. If the stomach is not secreting
normal proportions of pepsin or hydrochloric acid,
the deficiency of either can be determined. Such
chemical analysis will alone determine what elements
are lacking.</p>

<p>Permanent relief must lie in gaining a good circulation
of blood through the entire body and through the
stomach, that it may be strengthened and thus enabled
to secrete these elements in proper proportions.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Nervous
Indigestion</div>

<p>This is due to the general depleted condition
of the nerves. In such cases the
entire nervous system should be regulated
through exercise, breathing, rest, and a change of
thought. Physicians usually recommend change of
scene to cause a change of thought.</p>

<p>The diet should be light and laxative, and low in
protein. Cream soup, bread and milk, malted milk,
buttermilk, cream, fruits, crackers and milk, custards,
egg lemonade, and gruels, furnish easily digested
food.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee, much meat, fried food, highly spiced
food, pastry, candies, pickles, alcohol, and tobacco
should be avoided.</p>

<p>When the walls of the stomach are weak and
distended or prolapsed, light food served in small quantities
at regular but more frequent periods is preferable
to a hearty meal, which further distends the
stomach walls. The stomach does not secrete sufficient
gastric juices to digest a meal large enough to
supply the needs of the system, if food is taken only
three times a day.</p>

<p>When a loss of weight occurs, it usually indicates a
failure to <em>assimilate</em> rather than the failure to eat a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
sufficient amount of food. A good circulation, particularly
through the vital organs, must be established;
deep full breathing of fresh air, and regular and complete
rest periods, should be observed.</p>

<p>Usually, in chronic cases, a dietitian, or a physician,
is not called until the condition has prevailed for so
long that other complications have set in and the
patient has lost much flesh. It takes months to pull
the system down and it takes months of following of
proper hygiene to build it up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gastritis or
Catarrh of
the Stomach</div>

<p>This involves an inflammation of the
mucous lining of the stomach and is a most
common phase of indigestion. In acute
cases the physician is called at once. He
can then treat the case in its initial stage
and cause a much more rapid recovery.</p>

<p><em>Acute Gastritis</em> is accompanied by nausea and vomiting
and the patient should refrain from taking food for
at least two days. To allay thirst a tablespoonful
of water may be held in the mouth for a few moments
without swallowing it. A slice of lemon may be
sucked if water excites vomiting, or cold carbonated
or acidulated waters may be sipped, a teaspoonful at a
time, every ten or fifteen minutes. Rest of both
body and mind must be obtained.</p>

<p>After two days begin the nourishment with water
and a small portion of liquid food (not over two ounces)
every two hours. Toast tea, made by pouring hot
water over toast, oatmeal, or barley gruel (thoroughly
strained so that no coarse matter may irritate the
stomach), limewater and milk, and egg lemonade are
easily digested. Increase the quantity on the fourth
day and lengthen the time between feedings to three
hours. Gradually increase the diet, adding semiliquid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
food, noted on pages <a href="#Page_237">237-238</a>, soft-boiled eggs, moistened
toast, raw oysters, etc., slowly returning to the
regular bill of fare.</p>

<p>Avoid any food difficult of digestion and any vegetable
containing coarse fiber. Care in the diet must
be observed for several weeks or a relapse may occur.</p>

<p><em>Chronic Gastritis</em> is accompanied by a thickening of
the mucous lining of the stomach. It is usually
caused by prolonged use of irritating foods and the
regulation of the diet is of utmost importance. Alcohol
is a common cause. The difficulty begins
gradually and the relief will be gradual.</p>

<p>There is an excessive secretion of thick, tenacious
mucus which prevents the gastric juices from mixing
with the food. The resulting fermentation of food
causes heartburn and produces much gas. Thirst
may be excessive.</p>

<p>The stomach needs washing. The washing may be
accomplished by drinking two glasses of hot water at
least an hour before breakfast, followed by stomach
exercises, to cause a surging of the water through
the stomach. This may be followed by a glass of
cold water.</p>

<p>This may be uncomfortable at first, causing a full
feeling, and one may begin by drinking one glass,
followed by stomach exercises, gradually taking
another glass within a half-hour of the first. This,
by means of the exercises, will wash out the mucus.</p>

<p>A glass of cold water half an hour before each meal
is recommended here, as well as for relief of indigestion.</p>

<p>In many cases as much as a pint of slimy mucus
collects in the stomach during the night. When the
stomach cleansing by means of water drinking is
impossible, the physician often uses a stomach tube.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>Chronic gastritis, in any of its phases, is frequently
accompanied by constipation, which reacts on the
stomach, and the diet should be as laxative as possible,
without irritating the lining of the stomach.</p>

<p>In case an acute attack occurs, which is likely in
chronic cases, the diet under “Acute Gastritis”
should be followed.</p>

<p>Pancreatinized milk is an excellent food in both
chronic and acute cases especially when they are
severe. This is prepared by putting “pancreatin”
a pancreatic ferment (trypsin) into fresh milk.
Preparations of “pancreatin” are sold in the drug
stores. Pepsin may be used in the same way for
making peptonized milk.</p>

<p>The pancreatinized milk does not form hard curds
and readily passes through the stomach for digestion
in the intestine. The taste is rather bitter; it may be
disguised by flavoring. This may be given for a few
days, followed by milk and limewater, barley and toast
water, kumyss, oatmeal gruel, meat juices, scraped
meat (raw, boiled, or roasted), broths thickened with
thoroughly cooked cereals, ice cream, egg lemonade,
gelatins and whipped cream, custards and raw oysters.</p>

<p>Fruit in the morning and just before retiring aid
the intestines. Two prunes chopped up with one fig,
or a bunch of grapes, or an apple, just before retiring
may be eaten to assist the action of the intestines and
the kidneys.</p>

<p>Almost all fruits contain acids which increase the
peristalsis, and the resultant flow of gastric juice.
Cooked pears, stewed or baked apples, prunes, and
dates are mild fruits which may be used if they agree.
The juice of an orange on arising may be used if
relished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>All cereals should be thoroughly cooked.</p>

<p>The white meat of chicken, well masticated, is
readily digested.</p>

<p>After an acute attack, as the solid food is resumed,
it should be given regularly and in small amounts.</p>

<p><em>Thorough mastication is important. The food should
be chewed until it is reduced to a pulp.</em></p>

<p>Fats and food cooked in fat must be avoided.
Dried beef, lean boiled ham, and salt fish agree better
with some than fresh meats. All sweets must be forbidden.
Starchy foods are apt to produce “sour
stomach.”</p>

<p>Avoid meat with tough fiber, too fat meat (pork),
sausage, lobster, salmon, chicken salads, mayonnaise,
cucumbers, pickles, cabbage, tea, coffee, alcohol,
pastry, too much sweets, and cheese if it disagrees.</p>

<p>Five to six light meals a day are preferable to three
heavy meals.</p>

<p><em>The flow of gastric juices</em> is constitutional, thus the
regulation of digestion depends on the general vitality
as well as on foods. The circulation must be
forceful, the habit of deep breathing and of regular
periods of complete rest of body and mind must be
established.</p>

<p>Since one with chronic gastritis is liable to have
many idiosyncrasies, he should not be urged to eat
foods for which he has a dislike. The easily digested
foods should be prepared in various ways and served
in an appetizing, dainty manner.</p>

<p>There are four special phases of chronic gastritis:
Mucous Gastritis, Hyperchlorhydria, Hypochlorhydria,
and Achlorhydria.</p>

<p>In <em>Mucous Gastritis</em> there is a profuse secretion of
mucus in the stomach. In this case it is always well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
to wash out the stomach before introducing food, as
suggested above.</p>

<p>The same general diet suggested for acute gastritis
should be followed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hyperchlorhydria</div>

<p>The condition known as hyperchlorhydria
shows a liberal excess of hydrochloric
acid. The condition is common,
and is brought on by worry, nervous excitement,
eating when overtired, irregularity of meals, imperfect
mastication, and excessive use of alcohol.</p>

<p>The diet should be a mixed one, in about normal
proportions. If anything, it should incline more to
proteins than to starches.</p>

<p>The hydrochloric acid is necessary for the digestion
of proteins and some physicians give a diet consisting
almost entirely of proteins such as eggs, lean meat, etc.,
because hydrochloric acid reduces the protein to acid
albumin, which is less irritating to the stomach than
the free hydrochloric acid. However, the proteins
are stimulating to the stomach and the protein proportion
should not be carried to excess.</p>

<p>The best method is to follow a diet in which the
foods have practically their normal balance—avoiding
all irritating foods.</p>

<p>The juice of one-fourth of a lemon taken one-half
hour before the meal will decrease the secretion of
hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>Limewater and milk may be used exclusively for two
days; alkaline, effervescing mineral water may be
used and then the diet should follow the general diet
in chronic gastritis.</p>

<p><em>Hypochlorhydria</em> is a diminution in the amount
of hydrochloric acid. Since this acid is essential in
gastric digestion of proteins, a decrease in its supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
diminishes the power of the stomach to digest meat,
eggs, etc. Physicians often administer hydrochloric
acid about one hour after a meal. It should not
immediately follow the meal consisting of part solid
food, because it retards salivary digestion. Acid
fruits, such as lemonade or egg lemonade, should be
given half an hour after the meal instead of at the
beginning.</p>

<p>Many advocate a diet omitting protein, but since
protein foods stimulate the flow of gastric juices,
they should <em>not</em> be omitted, but taken less freely.
The meals should be at least six hours apart so as to
allow time for digestion and to give the stomach rest.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Achlorhydria</div>

<p>When there is an entire absence of hydrochloric
acid, as in <em>achlorhydria</em>, the stomach,
of course, cannot digest proteins and this
digestion must be accomplished entirely by the
trypsin of the pancreatic juice. The presence of
liquefied protein, as beef juice in the stomach, however
acts as a stimulus to the gastric juice and is an agency
in again starting its flow.</p>

<p>The foods should be liquid, so as to pass through the
stomach without irritating it. Clear milk must be
excluded, because of the action of the rennin in coagulating
the casein. This would irritate the stomach.</p>

<p>Pancreatinized milk (see page <a href="#Page_99">99</a>) may be used as
an article of diet, also milk with limewater, junket,
gelatin, cream, butter, bacon, olive oil, gruels, and any
foods which will pass through the stomach without
change and are digested by the pancreatic juice in
the intestines.</p>

<p>Bran must be excluded from any cereals. Cereals
or any carbohydrates cooked or masticated to a
liquid state will pass through the stomach without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
difficulty and be digested and absorbed in the small
intestine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dilatation
or Prolapsus
of the
Stomach</div>

<p>Dilatation results from continued overeating
(especially when the nerves are
weak), or eating when overtired. The
muscular walls become so weak that they
fail to contract. Peristalsis is likewise weak,
and the food, failing to digest promptly, ferments and
forms gas. A dilated stomach is enlarged and its
weight and weakness cause it to prolapse.</p>

<p>In the prolapsed condition the pyloric, or lower
orifice of the stomach, is often nearly closed, partly
by reason of its position and partly by the weakened
folds of the stomach walls. Because of this obstruction
to the free emptying of the contents into the duodenum,
it is imperative that the food be of the simplest
form, thoroughly masticated, and perhaps predigested
and concentrated so as to be in as small an amount
as possible. A chunk of food could not easily pass
through the pylorus.</p>

<p>All liquid or semiliquid food should be subject to
the chewing movements until it, also, is mixed with
saliva. The stomach should not be overloaded with
either food or water and for this reason six or more
light meals a day, at regular intervals, is best.</p>

<p>A dilated stomach does not necessarily indicate that
the digestive juices are not secreted in normal proportions,
and easily digested proteins need not be
avoided. It is desirable to furnish the proteins in
concentrated form, as in meats, so as to get the most
nutrition with the least bulk. They should be thoroughly
masticated.</p>

<p>Milk may be used, with limewater, if sipped slowly
and mixed with saliva.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>Sugar should be used very sparingly, because it
ferments readily and aggravates the distention. If it
is evident that fermented products are in the stomach,
it should be washed out with a stomach pump.</p>

<p>A tumor near the pylorus, or constriction of the
pyloric orifice by prolapsus, will also cause dilatation
of the stomach.</p>

<p>Beef juice, any of the better grades of meats, well
masticated and containing no gristle, limewater and
milk, soft-cooked eggs, and well-cooked cereals and
vegetables should constitute the diet.</p>

<p>Avoid vegetables containing coarse fiber, fried foods,
and freshly baked bread.</p>

<p>Liquid with the meal should be avoided, on account
of the tendency to overload the stomach.</p>

<p>Cold water, taken a swallow at a time at intervals
during the day, has a tonic effect on the relaxed
muscles. It also incites the flow of gastric juice.</p>

<p>The best and quickest means of correcting a prolapsed
and dilated stomach is by rest in bed for several
weeks, with special exercises to raise the viscera and
to strengthen all abdominal muscles, as well as the
muscular coat of the stomach itself. The food must
be given in small quantities every hour.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Ulcer
of the
Stomach</div>

<p>When this condition is severe, accompanied
with severe pains and vomiting of
blood, the nourishment is given through
the rectum for from five to ten days. Then,
for ten days, a milk diet with bouillon, barley water,
a beaten egg, and once a day, after the third day,
strained oatmeal gruel is taken.</p>

<p>Limewater is added to the milk to avoid the formation
of large curds and to neutralize the acids of the
stomach. The patient is given half a cup of milk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
every hour for three days, from 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
From the third to the tenth day the quantity may be
increased to one cupful, then to a cup and a half, and
the periods between feedings lengthened to two hours.
If the milk is thoroughly heated, but not boiled, before
the limewater is added, it digests more readily.</p>

<p>After ten days, for the succeeding ten days the
nourishment should be given every two hours and the
diet varied by semiliquid foods, such as gruels, toast
water, soft-boiled egg (once a day), beef juice, two
softened crackers (once a day), gelatin, buttermilk, and
strained soups. (See page <a href="#Page_313">313</a>, Semisolid Foods.)</p>

<p>After twenty days the patient, if all is well, may
very gradually resume a normal diet, beginning with
baked potatoes, softened toast, lamb chops, a small
piece of steak or white meat of chicken. It is imperative
that all food, liquid or solid, be thoroughly
mixed with saliva and that solids be chewed to a pulp.</p>

<p>Liquids must not be swallowed either hot or cold,
but about body temperature. Cold water may be
taken into the mouth when more palatable than warm
and held there until about body temperature before
it is swallowed. All liquids should be sipped, not
swallowed in gulps.</p>

<p>When the condition of ulcer has existed for some time
complete rest in bed for from six to ten weeks is
advisable. Either the diet suggested above or, if it is
desired to gain in weight, a diet of milk, cream, and
eggs may be followed. All solid food should be
avoided.</p>


<h3><em>INTESTINAL DISORDERS</em></h3>

<p>Most cases of intestinal difficulties may be traced
to a clogged condition, either due to a weakness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
nerves and of the intestinal muscles, with resultant
weak peristalsis, or to insufficient lubrication.</p>

<p>If the waste is not promptly moved through the
intestines, irritation may result and the poisons from
bacterial fermentation will be absorbed by the system.</p>

<p>Deranged digestion in the stomach also interferes
with digestion in the intestines. Likewise delayed
intestinal digestion affects digestion in the stomach.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Constipation</div>

<p>A large number of cases of constipation
become chronic because of the failure to
respond to Nature’s call at a regular time
each day. Many others are due to weakness of the
muscular walls of the intestines or to the nerves controlling
them. In this event the intestinal peristalsis
is weak.</p>

<p>Constipation may be mechanical, due to obstruction
of the intestine in some part of its course, <em>e. g.</em>, prolapsus,
tumor, or a kink in the bowel itself.</p>

<p>Still another cause is a failure of the liver to discharge
sufficient bile into the intestines to lubricate
the feces.</p>

<p>Many chronic cases are due to the pill and drug
habit. When one continues to take pills, the condition
brings a result similar to the feeding of “predigested”
food—if the work is done for the organs
they become lazy and rely on artificial aid. <em>Every
part of the body requires activity for strength.</em></p>

<p>If the intestines are cramped by the clothing it may
cause constipation by restraining their normal exercise
during movements of the body in walking, etc.
Exercises for the intestines should be taken morning
and night.</p>

<p>Constipation may exist even when there apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
is a daily movement of the bowels. Material may
accumulate in the large intestine because only a part
of the contents is discharged and may cause the
unpleasant symptoms which accompany constipation.</p>

<p>It may arise from irregularity in meals, or from
overeating, thus causing derangements of digestion
from disturbance of the normal process.</p>

<p>Insufficient food may cause it, because the mass is
not large enough to be acted on by the muscular
movements of the intestines.</p>

<p>Too much strong tea, by its astringent action, lessens
the secretions of mucus and causes the mass to
become too dry.</p>

<p>Too little water may be taken and the food not
sufficiently moistened; food may be concentrated and
leave little residue.</p>

<p>Overeating, especially when the intestinal muscles
are weak, furnishes a greater bulk than the intestines
have the power to propel, hence a semi-paralysis and
inactivity result.</p>

<p>Anxiety and grief or worry may inhibit the action of
the nerves and thus cause a stagnation of movement
on the part of the bowels.</p>

<p>The <em>cause</em> of the difficulty must be ascertained before
relief can be gained.</p>

<p>The most natural relief for constipation, therefore,
comes through exercise, particularly when directed to
the muscles of the stomach and of the intestines and
to the nerve centers controlling them.</p>

<p>The free use of water and such foods as figs and
raisins, prunes, dates, grapes, apples, and rhubarb,
which are laxative in effect, are helpful. These have
best effect when eaten just before retiring or when the
stomach is empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>The use of vegetables which furnish a large bulk
of fiber is often beneficial. Cabbage, celery, lettuce,
spinach, mustard greens, oyster plant, and asparagus
consist largely of residue. Onions are also laxative,
especially when boiled. Tomatoes possess a special
laxative effect for many individuals.</p>

<p>When derangements of digestion make raw fruits
undesirable, they may be cooked and thus used for
their laxative effect. They are not so laxative when
cooked with much sugar, because much sugar may
cause fermentation and gas. A little bicarbonate of
soda added to acid fruits after cooking will correct
the acidity and not so much sugar will be needed.</p>

<p>Two or three glasses of water should be taken on
rising and before retiring. This cleanses the stomach
as well as aids in relieving the dryness of the bowel
contents.</p>

<p>Oatmeal, or any cereal containing the bran, is
laxative. Such are bran or corn-meal bread, Boston
brown bread made with molasses, and Graham bread.</p>

<p>Children should be trained to attend to Nature’s
call regularly <em>every</em> day. The best time is shortly
after breakfast.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Enteritis</div>

<p><em>Inflammation or Catarrh of the Intestines</em>
is similar in its nature to Gastritis
or Catarrh of the Stomach.</p>

<p><em>Acute Enteritis</em>, or cholera morbus, is usually caused
by a strong irritant—either by some food which disagrees,
by unripe fruits, or by a mass of undigested
food.</p>

<p>A fast of two or three days is the usual initial
dietetic treatment.</p>

<p>A free drinking of water not only soothes the irritated
intestines, but it cleanses the intestinal tract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
and assists in eliminating elements of fermentation;
if these are not eliminated, they will be absorbed into
the blood.</p>

<p>Absolute quiet in bed is necessary.</p>

<p>After the fast, a liquid and semiliquid diet is followed
until inflammation is relieved and diarrhea and
vomiting have ceased. Milk, strained gruels, broths,
strained soups, buttermilk, eggs (soft cooked or raw),
beef juice, barley water, custards, junket gelatins, soft
puddings, etc., are most nourishing and cause little
irritation. (See page <a href="#Page_313">313</a>, Semisolid Foods.)</p>

<p>Milk should be mixed with limewater to prevent the
formation of large curds and should be sipped. Water
should not be taken, as it tends to increase the diarrhea.
Ice may be held in the mouth to relieve thirst.</p>

<p>All irritating foods, such as coarse vegetables, pickles,
acid fruits and fruits with coarse seeds, candies, beer,
wines, and salads must be omitted.</p>

<p><em>Chronic Enteritis</em> has the same general cause as
acute enteritis, though its onset is slow and it takes
a correspondingly longer time to correct.</p>

<p>A milk diet for two or three weeks may be necessary
to rest the bowels.</p>

<p>When food is taken, if undigested particles appear
in the stool, it may be necessary to use predigested
foods for a while.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dysentery</div>

<p>If acute, dysentery demands complete
rest in bed. The diet, in both acute and
chronic cases, must be confined to easily digested foods
such as peptonized or pancreatinized milk (see pages
<a href="#Page_99">99</a> and <a href="#Page_308">308</a>), boiled milk, meat juice, and the white of
egg, beaten and served with milk.</p>

<p>Blackberry brandy and tea made from wild cherry
bark tend to check the inflammation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>During convalescence, care must be taken not to
overfeed. Fruits and vegetables should be avoided.
Begin a more liberal diet with an increased amount of
beef juice, gradually adding tender beefsteak, roast
beef, fish, white meat of chicken, eggs, custards, jelly,
dry toast, blancmange, well-boiled rice, and other
easily digested food. The beef and egg are particularly
valuable, because of the anemia occasioned by
the loss of blood.</p>


<h3><em>DERANGEMENTS OF THE LIVER</em></h3>

<p>The liver is not, in a strict sense, a digestive organ,
but the digested food must pass through it and undergo
certain chemical changes.</p>

<p>For a fuller understanding of the reasons for the
following suggestions regarding diet in liver derangements,
the chapter on the “Work of the Liver,”
pages <a href="#Page_151">151-152</a> should be reread.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the liver acts not only on the
foods, but it also stands on guard to neutralize
poisonous ferments, due to putrefactions absorbed
from the intestines, and to render them harmless.
To a limited extent it also oxidizes alcohol.</p>

<p>After the gorging of a heavy meal, the overloaded
blood and liver express themselves in a sluggishness of
the brain and one feels mentally as well as physically
inert.</p>

<p>Since both carbohydrates and protein undergo
chemical changes in the liver, it is evident that a diet
consisting of an excess of either, must overwork the
liver, not only through the nutritive food elements
absorbed, but through the toxic substances which
may be produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>The regulation of diet, when the liver is in an abnormal
condition, must be more in the <em>quantity</em> than
in the <em>quality</em> of food.</p>

<p>The condition of the liver depends also on the
activity of the intestines, since the poisonous products
from imperfectly digested and fermenting food, not
being eliminated, will be absorbed and carried to the
liver. If the food remains in the intestines too long,
it is attacked by the bacteria always present there,
fermentation results and poisons are absorbed and
carried to the liver, which usually can render them
harmless to the system. If for any reason the liver
is diseased, overloaded, or its action is sluggish, these
toxins are absorbed in larger quantities than the liver
is able to handle, hence they reënter the blood and
poison the system.</p>

<p>The most important corrective agencies, when the
liver is inactive, is a fast for a day or two, a free drinking
of water, deep breathing, and exercise so directed
as to bring a free supply of blood to this organ.</p>

<p><em>It is apparent that the blood must carry its full quota
of oxygen to assist in eliminating both the nitrogenous
waste and the poisons.</em> It must also be remembered
that the liver must oxidize the waste from its own
tissues, as well as from other parts of the system.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Biliousness</div>

<p>This condition is due to the overproduction
of bile which may be absorbed into
the blood to inactivity of the body and a resultant
sluggish circulation of blood; to overwork of the
liver due to overeating; and to insufficient breathing
of pure air. It may also result from constipation
and the resultant absorption of toxic matter, as
previously described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>It may be occasioned also by obstruction of the
opening of the bile duct into the intestines from an
excess of mucus in the duodenum. In such cases
exercises for the intestines are clearly indicated.</p>

<p>In the bending, twisting, and squirming movements
which the infant in the cradle makes, the liver is
regularly squeezed and relaxed. The same is true of
the free movements of an active child at play. If
during adult life these same free movements of bending
and twisting the trunk were continued daily and
correct habits of free breathing of pure air were
established, there would be little call for “liver
tonics.”</p>

<p>The transformation of carbohydrates in the liver is
an important part of its work and in case of inactive
liver the sugars and starches should be limited in the
diet. Protein stimulates the activity of the liver, yet
it is a mistake to allow a diet too rich in protein.
The best method is to cut down the quantity of food.</p>

<p>Two glasses of water an hour before breakfast,
followed by brisk exercise for the vital organs and
deep breathing, are the best remedies.</p>

<p>The daily action of the bowels is imperative.</p>

<p>In extreme cases a fast of two or three days, with a
copious use of water, is recommended. Following this
fast the diet should consist of easily digested foods,
eliminating those containing starch and sugar in too
great proportions, as bread, cereals, and potatoes.
The amount should be as limited as is consistent with
the actual necessity for rebuilding and for energy.</p>

<p>The taking of fats should be restricted in biliousness.
The presence of fat in the duodenum stimulates
the flow of pancreatic juice, which in turn stimulates
the secretion of bile, thus overworking the liver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Lemon stimulates the action of the gastric glands
and thus tends to increase the liver activity.</p>

<p>It has been thought that eggs and milk cause sluggish
liver action. There is no physiological reason for
this if too much food is not eaten. The fact is often
lost sight of that milk is a food as well as a beverage
and that when milk constitutes an appreciable part of
the diet other foods should be limited accordingly.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">DIET</span> may be selected from the following:</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Gallstones</div>

<p>Gallstones occur most often in persons
after middle life, especially in those of
sedentary habits.</p>

<p>A substance called cholesterin is normally present
in solution in bile and in the tissues. When, through
inactivity of the liver, or when because of sedentary
habits the bile remains too long in the system, the
cholesterin is precipitated, and, mixed with mucus,
it forms gall-stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>A diet composed mostly of starch and fat favors
their formation.</p>

<p>All dietetic measures should be combined with
exercise to promote the flow of bile into the intestines.</p>

<p>Two glasses of hot water should be taken in the
morning and before retiring. Several glasses of cold
water should be drunk through the day.</p>

<p>Sweets and starches should be largely eliminated
from the diet; sweet fruits and root vegetables must
be avoided.</p>

<p>Fresh green vegetables and acid fruits may be
taken. Potatoes contain calcium, but because they
contain much more potassium, which lessens the liberation
of calcium, they may also be used.</p>

<p>For foods rich in calcium which should be avoided
see page <a href="#Page_219">219</a>.</p>

<p>Foods causing calcium oxalate deposits should be
avoided as they may cause the formation of gall-stones.
For a list of these see p. <a href="#Page_219">219</a>.</p>

<p>Meat, if taken, must be lean and eaten only once a
day. Beef and chicken are the preferable meats.
Fresh fish may be used.</p>

<p>Alcohol must not be taken and coffee and tea must
be limited in strength and quantity.</p>

<p>Active exercise must be practiced daily and full
elimination secured from the bowels.</p>

<p>The person afflicted with gall-stones must not sit too
long or in a cramped position.</p>

<p>The presence of fat in the duodenum increases the
flow of pancreatic juice which, in turn, stimulates the
flow of bile, so olive oil is often recommended in case
of gall-stones. It is questionable whether it is of
benefit, because, as stated, much fat upsets the
liver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Watch the water supply. Hard water which
contains lime should be boiled to precipitate the
calcium.</p>


<h3><em>DERANGEMENTS OF THE KIDNEYS</em></h3>

<p>The office of the kidneys is to eliminate from the
system certain nitrogenous elements in solution; the
work of the kidneys, in most conditions, is aided by
copious drinking of water.</p>

<p>The influence exerted on the function of the excretory
organs by the components of the food has not
been given the attention it merits.</p>

<p>If the fluids are not taken in sufficient amount and
much animal food is eaten, the urine becomes more
concentrated and may irritate the kidneys or the
bladder and give rise to calculi (kidney stones) or to
the deposit of uric acid. Watery vegetables, juicy
fruits, milk, water, and most beverages, by increasing
the output of urine, lessen its acidity and density.</p>

<p>A diet limited to certain articles of food by the likes
or dislikes of the individual, as the starches and sugars,
too large consumption of acid fruits or too fatty foods
may cause the appearance in the urine of abnormal
amounts of various substances, as sugar, phosphates,
calcium oxalate, or fatty acids.</p>

<p>Acid fruits in moderation aid digestion and favor
suitable elimination, but when eaten to excess, as
lemons, taken two or three or more a day by those
striving to reduce flesh, the urine is increased in acidity,
and irritation of the bladder may ensue.</p>

<p>Too great an amount of food tends to overwork the
kidneys as well as the liver and various derangements
result; these must be treated dietetically as well as by
medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel">Acute
Nephritis</div>

<p>In inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis), the
secretion of urine is lessened or may cease.
The kidneys and digestive system must
not be overworked and all food must be
eliminated save milk until the kidney function is
restored. It may be diluted with lime or Vichy, or
skimmed milk or buttermilk may be used.</p>

<p>Water flushes the kidneys and if the urine increases
in amount when water is given its use may be continued.
When the amount of urine is diminished or
the kidneys are not functioning at all, water, or any
fluid or food that gives the kidneys work, must be given
only on the advice of a physician, as serious harm may
be done unless the inflamed kidneys are given as near
perfect rest as possible. Sometimes even milk must
be reduced to one pint a day.</p>

<p>In the event that the kidneys do not excrete, the
pores of the skin must be kept freely open by sweat
baths to assist in the elimination of urea.</p>

<p>Dr. Hall recommends a milk and cream diet of
from three to seven pints a day, for a few days, according
to the case—two parts of milk to one of cream. If the
urine is scanty, he reduces it to one and one-half
pints a day, taken in four or five installments.
After the three to seven days of milk diet he
gradually introduces starches and fats into the diet.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Bright’s
Disease</div>

<p>This is an inflammatory condition of
the kidneys in which albumin appears in
the urine. It results from irritation and
may be acute or chronic.</p>

<p>The appearance of albumin in the urine does not
always indicate disease. It may be temporary, merely
indicating that the diet, for the time being, is too heavy
or contains an excess of protein, especially meat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
Several tests from one to two weeks apart are often
necessary to determine whether the condition is merely
temporary or is due to inefficient action of the kidneys.</p>

<p>When for any reason the kidneys have difficulty
in eliminating the nitrogenous waste of the system,
the dietitian must eliminate protein food as closely
as may be consistent with the body necessities. Besides
restricting the amount of nitrogenous foods, the
kidneys must be assisted in eliminating the nitrogenous
waste and the products of inflammation by a copious
drinking of water, unless the kidneys are so inflamed
that complete rest is indicated.</p>

<p>Hot water and hot drinks are best in the morning,
such as toast water, barley water, cream of tartar,
lemon and acid drinks. Unless a dropsical condition
is present one may drink freely of cool water.</p>

<p>In acute cases the patient is put on a diet of from
two to three pints of milk a day, given one-half pint
every three or four hours, diluted with one-third as
much hot water. Complete rest is imperative.</p>

<p>In chronic cases, exercise, judiciously directed to the
extremities, particularly to the legs and the back, will
do more than anything to aid the elimination of an
excessive accumulation of fluid as in dropsy. This
condition is usually accompanied by constipation and
poor circulation, and exercises directed to the liver and
bowels aid in carrying off the excess of fluid by way of
the intestines; this will rest the kidneys. A cure
requires patience and perseverance.</p>

<p>In chronic cases it is also well to follow a milk diet
for a number of weeks. The quantity of milk for an
exclusive milk diet must depend on the age and size
of the patient as well as on his ability to exercise.
If he is confined to his room, from ten to sixteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
glasses of milk a day are sufficient. If he is taking a
great deal of exercise, he may take from eighteen to
twenty glasses of milk a day. If he loses weight on the
milk diet, bread and rice may be added, or potato
soup, cereals, tapioca, and various gruels.</p>

<p>If the milk is not well borne, malted milk or predigested
milk with butter and cream may be substituted.
If the casein in the milk is not well digested,
cheese must not be used. An egg once or twice a week
and fruit and fresh vegetables may be given, but meat
should be omitted.</p>

<p>A. F. Pattee gives the following diet in Bright’s
disease.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent"><em>DIET</em></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p><em>Soup.</em>—Vegetable or fish soup, broths with rice or barley.</p>

<p><em>Fish.</em>—Raw oysters or clams, fresh fish broiled or boiled.</p>

<p><em>Meats.</em>—Eat sparingly, chicken, game, fat bacon, fat ham.</p>

<p><em>Farinaceous.</em>—Stale bread, whole wheat bread, toast, milk
toast, biscuits, macaroni, rice, cereals of all kinds.</p>

<p><em>Vegetables.</em>—Onion, cauliflower, mashed potatoes, mushrooms,
lettuce, watercress, spinach, celery, cabbage.</p>

<p><em>Desserts.</em>—Ripe raw fruits, stewed fruits, rice, tapioca, bread
and milk puddings, junkets, cocoa.</p>

<p><em>Liquids.</em>—Toast water, weak tea, pure water, peptonized milk,
malted milk, fresh buttermilk, milk and hot water in equal parts,
whey, unfermented grape juice.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">AVOID.</span>—Fried fish, corned beef, hashes, stews, pork, veal,
heavy bread, batter cakes, lamb, mutton, beef, gravies, beans,
peas, malt or spirituous liquors, tobacco, coffee, ice cream, cake,
pastry.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>This diet is tentative only and may be modified
to suit the individual. If improvement is manifest
after a month or two of the restricted diet, steak, roast
beef, and eggs may be gradually added. If, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
urine is examined, the use of meat causes a return of
albumin, it must be dropped.</p>

<p>In these cases, active outdoor exercise, full, deep
breathing systematically practiced at intervals, a
calm quiet attitude of mind and care not to overeat
and to keep the bowels active will materially aid
recovery.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Uremia or
Uremic
Poisoning</div>

<p>Interference with the action of the
kidneys is apt to result in a retention within
the system of the elements which they, in
normal condition, eliminate from the system—such
as urea, uric acid, urates, sulphates,
phosphates, etc. They are the result of the oxidation
and the breaking down of the proteins of the
body. If the kidneys do not eliminate these the
result is a systemic poisoning, and the dietetic treatment
must be such as will aid them to act freely.</p>

<p>Fruits should be used freely. The citrus fruits
(lemons, oranges, limes, etc.) are the best; they
neutralize acids and promote the alkalinity of the
blood.</p>

<p>When the system shows an excess of uric acid, the
chances are that the individual has not been living
on a diet containing too large a proportion of protein,
but that he has been eating more than he requires of all
kinds of foodstuffs. His system thus becomes weakened
and he does not breathe deeply nor exercise
sufficiently to oxidize and throw off the waste.</p>

<p>Meats, eggs, and legumes should be eliminated from
the diet. A free drinking of water, milk with limewater,
cereals, buttermilk, kumyss, barley water, toast
water, lemonade, orangeade, vegetables, and fruit
should form the diet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>Exercise and free breathing of fresh air are imperative.
All food should be thoroughly masticated.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Excess
of Uric
Acid</div>

<p>When this condition appears it is due to
too great an amount of animal or nitrogenous
food. It causes dizziness, ringing in
the ears, general nervousness, and insomnia.</p>

<p>Uric acid does not render the urine acid but when
the acidity of the urine is increased, due to too much
animal food, the tendency of the uric acid to form a
crystalline deposit is increased. This deposit, as
“gravel,” may occasion attacks of renal colic or
become the basis, when mixed with mucus, for kidney
stones or stones in the bladder.</p>

<p>Headaches if due to uric acid will often cease when
animal food is lessened.</p>

<p>Too much candy or sweet foods, or too much fat,
eaten in connection with much protein, by deranging
the liver function, change the character of the urine
and favor the production of uric acid, causing such
chronic ailments as bronchitis, asthma, severe nerve
depression, gout, and neuralgia.</p>

<p>The natural relief is obtained by control of the diet,
supplying less protein. One may either eliminate the
proteins from the diet, or may cut down the entire
quantity of food. Free elimination through a free
action of the kidneys, the pores of the skin, and the
lungs, is necessary.</p>

<p>Systematic exercise, deep breathing, copious drinking
of water, and fresh air day and night, are the best
aids. Exercise and deep breathing promote a free
elimination of waste through the pores of the skin, and
the free drinking of water creates a greater elimination
through the kidneys, thus throwing off the excess of
acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>The skins of fruits contain various acids which favor
the alkalinity of the blood. Therefore it is better,
when there is an excess of uric acid, to eat unpeeled
fruits. Apples, eaten raw and unpeeled, because of
the acids, are of benefit. Citrus fruits, such as lemons,
oranges, and grapefruit, are advised. Pears, and other
sweet or bland fruits, because of the lack of acid, are
less valuable.</p>

<p>Pea pods when young may be cooked with the peas.
String beans, spinach, celery, and asparagus are of
value.</p>

<p>All rich sauces and gravies must be avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gout</div>

<p>Osler remarks that “gout is evidence of
an overfed, overworked, and consequently
clogged machine.”</p>

<p>It is usually the result of high living. It most often
attacks people past middle age, who have indulged
in large quantities of food, especially the nitrogenous
foods which are not thoroughly oxidized due to sluggish
circulation and shallow breathing. The process,
imperfectly carried on, allows the accumulation of
the waste material which cannot be excreted by the
kidneys unless completely transformed by oxidation.
These insoluble materials are deposited in the joints,
act as irritants, and occasion the attacks of pain,
swelling, and tenderness which usually mark the acute
condition.</p>

<p>It is most common in those who habitually overeat,
take little exercise, or who have frequently indulged in
alcohol.</p>

<p>Sugar and fat in quantities are injurious as the
oxidation of the protein is not carried on as completely
when these are in excess. In fact, the entire system is
more sluggish. Fat also interferes with gastric digestion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
as it passes through the stomach unchanged,
and if the particles of food have a coat of the fat
liquefied by the heat of the stomach, it is difficult for
the gastric juice to exert its power.</p>

<p>The use of meat and sugars tends to make the urine
acid and the use of vegetables favors its alkalinity,
rendering it less acid. Therefore it becomes necessary
to eliminate meat from the diet, to cut down the fats
and carbohydrates, and to eat freely of fruits and
vegetables.</p>

<p>Alcohol is absolutely prohibited.</p>

<p>In <em>acute cases</em> a diet of bread and milk, or toast and
milk, with light vegetable broths, should be followed
for from one to three days.</p>

<p>In <em>chronic cases</em> the diet may consist of the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p><em>Soups.</em>—Vegetable broths.</p>

<p><em>Fish.</em>—Fresh fish, shell fish, raw oysters.</p>

<p><em>Meats.</em>—It is better to omit all meats. If meat is eaten at all,
it should be confined to game, chicken, and fat bacon.</p>

<p><em>Farinaceous.</em>—Cereals, crackers, dry toast, milk toast, macaroni,
graham or whole wheat bread, rye bread, oatmeal, and any of the
breakfast foods.</p>

<p><em>Vegetables.</em>—Celery, lettuce, watercress, all greens, without
vinegar, string beans, green peas, potatoes, carrots, and beets.</p>

<p><em>Fruits.</em>—All fruits, stewed or fresh. Unpeeled apples are
especially recommended. (Greens, without vinegar and unpeeled
apples, increase the action of the kidneys.)</p>

<p><em>Desserts.</em>—Plain puddings, junket, rice, stewed or fresh fruits.</p>

<p><em>Liquids.</em>—Pure water, toast water, barley water, buttermilk,
malted milk, milk.</p>

<p>Eat eggs sparingly, and in severe cases, not at all.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">AVOID.</span>—Alcohol, coffee, tobacco, dried fruits, nuts, cheese,
candies, pastries, pies, spices, rich puddings, fried foods, vinegar,
pickles, lemons, rhubarb, mushrooms, asparagus, sweet potatoes,
tomatoes, gravies, patties, rich soups, lobster, salmon, crabs,
mackerel, eel, veal, pork, goose, duck, turkey, salted, dried,
potted, or preserved fish or meat (except bacon).</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>It is not sufficient to eliminate the foods to be
avoided. To reduce the quantity of food is also necessary;
yet this must be watched as the diet should not
be so rigid as to cause a lowering of vitality. Eating
between meals should not be allowed.</p>

<p>In an acute attack the diet should be confined to
milk, vegetables, and fruits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diabetes</div>

<p>This is the result of a serious disturbance
of nutrition. Since its presence is made
manifest by the appearance of sugar in the urine, it is
considered among the derangements of the kidneys.
However, one should not be apprehensive of diabetes
if the urine test for a day shows sugar. This may be
due to an excess of carbohydrates, particularly of
sugar, in the diet a day or two previous and all trace
of it may disappear in a day or two. If continued
tests show an excess, nutritional disturbances are
indicated. The treatment is almost entirely dietetic.</p>

<p>The most usual form of diabetes is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diabetes mellitus</i>.
It is supposed to be due to a disturbance in the metabolism
of sugar. It may be aided by defective pancreatic
ferments, the lack throwing more work on the
liver in the metabolism of sugar.</p>

<p>The difficulty which confronts the dietitian is to
prescribe a diet restricting the carbohydrates which
will keep up the body weight and not disturb the
nutritive equilibrium. The patient has a craving for
sugars and starches, but the system cannot make use
of them, and the heat and energy must be supplied by
fats.</p>

<p>The diet must consist largely of protein and fat.
One danger lies in the tendency of acetic and other
acids to accumulate in the blood, which affects the
nervous system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>While, as a rule, the craving for certain foods is an
indication that the system needs the elements contained
in them, the desire of the diabetic patient for
sugars and starches <em>must not</em> be indulged more than
absolutely necessary, because of the inability of the
system to utilize them.</p>

<p>There is often a distaste for fat, but its use is imperative
when it is well borne, because the weight and
general vitality must be maintained. If all carbohydrates
are eliminated from the diet, the system will
often suffer severely. Therefore the dietitian must
determine the diet suited to the individual case, since
complicated conditions may exist and the diet for one
patient will work harm to another. The fleshy patient
can stand a rigid diet, eliminating sugars and starches,
much better than one who is thin and emaciated.
A thin, weak patient often cannot endure too rigid a
diet.</p>

<p>The following list of foods contain least carbohydrates:
clear soup of meat without vegetables, all acid
fruits, eggs, clams, and lobsters, fresh fish of all kinds,
fresh meat of all kinds, and most smoked meat, olive
oil, butter, peas, beans, all fresh vegetables (except
carrots, parsnips, squash), onions, artichokes, cauliflower,
cabbage, and asparagus.</p>

<p>Fats may be supplied in the yolks of eggs, cream,
butter, cheese, bacon, and oily nuts, as butternuts,
Brazil nuts, almonds, hazel nuts, walnuts, pecans;
all should be well chewed.</p>

<p>In beginning a diet, the change must not be too
sudden. Potatoes, when they agree, may be used in
small quantities as a substitute for bread. At least
a week’s time should be allowed for the elimination of
all sugar and starch. Begin by eliminating sugars and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
next bread, cereals, anything made with flour, and
potatoes.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to begin with an all milk
diet for a day or two.</p>

<p>Van Noorden gives the following diet, free from
carbohydrates, which has been in general use in
Europe and America.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><em>Breakfast</em></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Tea or coffee, 6 ounces.</p>

<p>Lean meat (beefsteak, mutton chop, or ham), 4 ounces.</p>

<p>Eggs, one or two.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><em>Lunch</em></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Cold roast beef, 6 ounces.</p>

<p>Celery, or cucumbers, or tomatoes with salad dressing.</p>

<p>Coffee, without milk or sugar, 2 ounces.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><em>Dinner</em></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Bouillon, 6 ounces.</p>

<p>Roast beef, 7<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> ounces.</p>

<p>Green salad, 2 ounces.</p>

<p>Vinegar, 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> drams.</p>

<p>Butter, 2<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> drams.</p>

<p>Olive oil, 5 drams, or spinach with mayonnaise, large portion.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90"><em>Supper, 9 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span></em></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Two eggs, raw or cooked.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Van Noorden includes alcohol, in whisky, in his
diet and most physicians follow the theory that alcohol
aids in the digestion and absorption of fats; the
need is recognized since fats must be supplied, yet
the sweet wines and beers contain sugar while the sour
wines contains acids, which may disturb digestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>


<h3><em>DERANGEMENTS OF LUNGS AND BRONCHI</em></h3>

<div class="sidenotel">Asthma</div>

<p>In this affection the free entrance of air
into the lungs as well as its free exit is
hampered by a condition of the bronchial muscles,
the mucous membrane of the bronchi, and the muscles
of the diaphragm. The muscles contract spasmodically
without due or proper relaxation. This causes
a congestion and swelling of the mucous membrane
of the bronchi which still further hamper the ingress
and egress of air.</p>

<p>Any digestive derangement which causes the formation
of gas distends the stomach and intestines,
interferes with the free action of the diaphragm,
and prevents the free movement of the abdominal
muscles.</p>

<p>The chemical action of the undigested and fermenting
substances in the digestive tract irritates the
nerves and may cause the spasm of the muscles.
Digestive derangements will often cause the onset of
an attack of asthma in those afflicted with this disorder.</p>

<p>The correction of the conditions in the stomach and
intestinal tract will often ameliorate the attacks.
Care must be taken not to overload the stomach and
intestines, to eat easily digested foods which agree in
the particular case. All food found to cause any
digestive disturbance should be avoided.</p>

<p>Constipation must be remedied by gentle exercises
and massage of the abdomen as free elimination removes
material which might aid in inciting an attack.</p>

<p>Many asthmatics are comparatively comfortable
during the day, the attacks coming on toward evening
or during the night. In this case, the evening meal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
should be light and easily digested, the heavy meal
being taken at noon.</p>

<p>Hot stuffy rooms increase the disorder and plenty
of fresh air should be secured both by night and by
day.</p>

<p>Many of these individuals make no exertion, fearing
to bring on an attack.</p>

<p>Exercise, particularly of the lungs in breathing,
should be gradual at first and be increased as improvement
is shown. Exercises directed to expansion of the
deeper cells of the lungs and to equalize the circulation
throughout the entire system will call the excess of
blood from the bronchial tubes and in many cases will
cause the difficulty to disappear. A forceful, equalized
circulation, with regulation of digestion, will do
more for asthma than any known agency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tuberculosis</div>

<p>Derangements in digestion, common in
this affection, are due to several conditions.</p>

<p>The increased temperature is caused
by the efforts of the system to counteract the poisons
produced by the action of the bacillus. The increase
in temperature in the stomach lessens the secretions
and the peristaltic action, causing the food to ferment
and to be vomited or to pass practically undigested
into the intestine, thus throwing an excess of work on
the intestinal secretions.</p>

<p>The bacilli-laden sputum, if swallowed, is apt to
produce disorders of the stomach. This still further
complicates the question of digestion.</p>

<p>Malnutrition, because of these derangements, increases
the unfavorable outlook for the patient in this
disease. Hence the diet, especially in chronic cases,
is of great importance.</p>

<p>When means are ample, the question is much simplified,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
because by travel, change of scene, and pleasant
surroundings the appetite is stimulated and
greater variety in the diet can be gained. For those
in moderate circumstances, save when free sanatoriums
exist for the care of the tuberculous, it is most
difficult to keep the diet from becoming monotonous
and wearisome.</p>

<p>The appetite, especially in young people, is apt to be
capricious, and it is important that the food be served
daintily to tempt the patient to eat.</p>

<p>Growing children crave sweets and as these furnish
energy they may be allowed to tuberculous children,
in moderation, if they seem to be well assimilated.
Any interference with digestion, however, must be
guarded against.</p>

<p>It is better to give food in smaller quantities and
oftener in order to guard against disturbed digestion
from overloading the stomach. For this reason also
it is better to give the heartiest food during the
forenoon when the temperature is lowest.</p>

<p>Milk, butter, cream, olive oil, bacon, and cod-liver
oil furnish the fat needed by the system in the most
easily digested form and should be taken freely, if there
is no irritation in the stomach which will prevent their
assimilation. Variation in their use will often secure
greater tolerance.</p>

<p>In chronic cases in which there is little or no fever,
the fats are generally well assimilated and are
beneficial.</p>

<p>The disease causes great wasting, and fats are especially
important in counteracting this tendency.
They may be given in alternation or be omitted from
the diet for a day or two to avoid turning the patient
against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>If diarrhea exists fats must be given guardedly and
if fats produce diarrhea they must be lessened or
omitted until the diarrhea is controlled.</p>

<p>If one gains in flesh the chances are very strong that
the case has been wrongly diagnosed, or that the disease,
if present, is being overcome.</p>

<p>Milk, when it agrees, should form a large part of the
diet. A glass may be taken with meals and two glasses
between meals. The milk should be sipped slowly;
lime water or carbonated water may be added to aid
milk digestion.</p>

<p>Buttermilk, made by means of buttermilk tablets,
from milk from which the cream has not been removed,
or buttermilk mixed with one-fourth cream, kumyss, or
cream and water, if relished, may take the place of
milk.</p>

<p>Eggs are also important aids in the diet, especially
the yolk, because of the fat and iron it contains. If
they disagree they may be taken with a few drops of
lemon juice, orange juice, or grape juice, as these
partially digest the egg.</p>

<p>The beaten and strained whites are very easily
digested, and in that form may be taken in quantity
of from six to twelve a day.</p>

<p>Tender, juicy meats, especially beef and mutton,
may be taken, also meat juices and beef soups.</p>

<p>Highly seasoned foods should be avoided.</p>

<p>Fresh fish, clams, and oysters are permissible.
Cereals, especially the coarse ones, that stimulate
the bowel movements, if constipation exists, are valuable;
oatmeal, rice, and corn-meal mush are especially
good; also Graham or bran bread, and zwieback made
with bran. If there is diarrhea bran should not be
used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>Easily digested vegetables are of value, especially
if cooked in little water so that most of the salts and
other nutrients, which are so frequently boiled out of
the vegetable, are retained. Baked apples or raw
fruits, especially oranges, may be taken the first thing
in the morning, or used as a dessert. Grapes, peaches,
and other fruits in season may be taken in moderation.</p>

<p>Tea and coffee are best omitted.</p>

<p>The following constitutes a typical menu in ordinary
cases. It must be varied to suit the individual
case.</p>


<table class="autotable fs90">
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><em>Breakfast</em>:</td>
<td class="tdl">Fruit, cereal, two eggs (poached or boiled) with or
without a few slices of bacon; two slices of toast or
bread, one-half ounce of butter, and a glass of milk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><em>10 a.m.</em>:</td>
<td class="tdl">Two or three eggs beaten in a glass of milk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><em>Luncheon</em>:</td>
<td class="tdl">Fish, chop, or steak, or some tender meat, one-half
ounce of butter, one or two slices of bread, baked
potato, or a dish of rice or hominy, green vegetables,
or a salad of lettuce or tomato with olive oil, a
dessert of custard or junket or some other nutritious
dish, and a glass of milk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><em>3 p.m.</em>:</td>
<td class="tdl">Milk and eggs, meat broth and egg, milk and egg
custard, or Graham crackers and milk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><em>Dinner</em>:</td>
<td class="tdl">Soup if desired, a glass of milk, a liberal helping of
some special meat, roast beef, lamb, or mutton,
chicken or turkey, potatoes, or a farinaceous vegetable,
and a green vegetable, dessert, and a small
piece of cheese.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

<p>This menu approximates the number of calories
desirable in cases of tuberculosis that have not advanced
to a stage in which complete rest is necessary.
In that case a liquid or semiliquid diet is given.</p>

<p>When it is necessary that the diet be less expensive,
beans, lentils, and eggs may take the place of meat at
some meals, and oleomargarine may be substituted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
butter. Milk and eggs, however, in the quantity
advised, should be taken if possible.</p>

<p>If signs of overfeeding appear, due to the lessened
activity of the digestive organs, shown by biliousness,
coated tongue, etc., the food may be lessened in quantity
until the condition is corrected.</p>

<p>If the tongue becomes coated the mouth should
receive the care directed on page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>.</p>

<p>In all cases of weak lungs and chronic lung trouble,
the diet should consist of easily digested foods. Those
that cause flatulence should be avoided, as the distended
stomach presses on the diaphragm and interferes
with proper breathing and with the heart action.</p>


<h3><em>DERANGEMENTS OF THE NERVES</em></h3>

<p>No disturbance in any part of the body requires less
medicine than a disturbance in the nerves. The
correction must come through general hygienic treatment
and directing the mind to optimistic thoughts.</p>

<p>Regular exercise, alternated with regular rest
periods, the formation of the habit of complete nerve
relaxation, the general regulation of an easily digested,
nutritious diet, with deep breathing exercises, are the
best remedies. The patient should be out of doors as
much as possible and, unless too weak, should be
employed at light work for mental diversion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Neurasthenia</div>

<p>In cases of Neurasthenia, or “tired
nerves,” all vital organs are more or less
affected, because the nerves do not properly
direct digestion, absorption, assimilation, or elimination.</p>

<p>The excessive use of stimulants, tea, coffee, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
alcohol, is often an exciting cause, because of overstimulation
of an already exhausted nervous system.</p>

<p>Complete rest of body and mind must be secured.</p>

<p>The diet should be light and of easily digested foods,
but must be nutritious and taken regularly and systematically.
Each case needs individual treatment,
and the diet must be that most easily assimilated by
the individual.</p>

<p><em>A free, correct breathing of fresh air, day and night,
is imperative.</em></p>

<p>It is important also to thoroughly masticate all food
and drink freely of water.</p>

<p>A change of thought, induced by a change of scene
or companions, is helpful.</p>

<p>One of the most essential treatments of neurasthenia
is to surround the patient with love and tenderness,
but the patient should be led to avoid self-pity.
This sets up a disagreeable trend of thought which
relaxes nerve and vital forces and disturbs nutrition.
Sympathy, good cheer, and an attitude of courageous
optimism are the best nerve tonics.</p>

<p>Due to the weakened condition of the nerves,
troubles which at other times seem trifles are as
mountains and very real. Patience and intelligent
sympathy, not apparent pity, are the best of medicines.</p>

<p>The tone of the nervous system is quickly altered
by the state of mind of the individual. The reaction
is a double one, constituting a “vicious circle.” The
nerves, disordered from worry, excessive fatigue, or
other drains on the vitality, as a persistent pessimistic
outlook on life, do not stimulate the natural digestive
processes. The faulty digestion may fail to prepare
a sufficient amount of food for use by the system.
The nerves are thus underfed, which still further increases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
their inability to send motor and secretory
impulses to the digestive and eliminative organs.
Emaciation, general debility, and anemia may result.</p>

<p>Hence the importance, in the relief of any nervous
condition, to see first that the attitude of mind be calm
and quiet with the substitution of thoughts of hope
and cheer for those of gloom and depression. The
afflicted one must make a brave struggle because the
tired body affects his thoughts as well as his thoughts
his body.</p>

<p>There is no one food or set of foods which directly
affect any nervous trouble unless this trouble be
localized by disturbance in some particular organ.
Then the effort must be to correct the difficulty in that
organ.</p>

<p>Rest is imperative.</p>

<p>If thin, a fat-building diet should be followed to
store energy-building reserve in the nerve centers.</p>

<p>In many cases of nerve debility the nerves seem to
be stronger in the latter part of the day. When this
is the case the hearty meal should be eaten at this
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neuralgia</div>

<p>The condition of the blood is affected by
the lack of its necessary ingredients, which
may occur through faulty digestion as well as through
improper diet. The resultant anemia of the nerves
may produce neuralgic pains in any one or several of
the tissues and organs, as the stomach, the intestines,
the muscles, or the liver, etc. Neuralgia of the liver
is sometimes mistaken for gallstone colic.</p>

<p>When underlying conditions of disease have been
excluded by means of careful tests of the urine and
blood, the diet becomes of importance and may result
in the disappearance of the pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>These pains occur chiefly in those who take little
exercise and use improper food, which does not give
the correct proportion of the needed elements to the
system.</p>

<p>Exercise, as the body is usually weak, should be
begun moderately but as soon as possible be made
brisk and active to stimulate the vital organs to a
more perfect performance of their function.</p>

<p>Plenty of oxygen must be secured by day and night
and thorough elimination be maintained.</p>

<p>The diet must be nutritious and richer than is
ordinarily taken. Milk, butter, cream, bacon, olive
oil, and all fatty food should be freely used if assimilated.
Beefsteak, roast beef, fresh vegetables, and
eggs are valuable. Cocoa or chocolate, a glass of milk
with a beaten egg, or a cup of broth into which an egg
has been beaten may be regularly taken between
meals.</p>

<p>If the digestion is feeble, light foods should first
be taken and increased as the system becomes able
to assimilate more hearty food.</p>

<p>Coffee, tea, highly spiced foods, alcohol, fried food,
rich pastry, and much candy or sweet stuffs should be
avoided.</p>

<p>Pain referred to the liver, if not caused by gall-stones,
usually indicates overwork of that organ, and fats,
sweets, and starches should be avoided to give the
liver rest.</p>

<p>Pain referred to the stomach is often caused by
tobacco smoking or improper food, as too much candy
or preserves, or too strong tea or coffee. Attention to
the diet will usually relieve this variety of pain. If
the pain comes on when the stomach is empty, due
to a disorder of the nerves, the food should be lessened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
in quantity, be light, easily digested, and taken at
shorter intervals.</p>

<p>Many conditions of the system due to dietetic
errors which result in impoverished blood are accompanied
by pains in the stomach. These are often
neuralgic.</p>

<p>Poor assimilation of foods or indigestion produces
pain because the tone of the nervous system is affected
from the poor blood.</p>

<p>Neuralgia of the stomach often occurs in anemic
conditions associated with constipation. In these
cases a good, nutritious, but easily digested diet and
better elimination will often cure, but as the changes
in the blood and nerves are slow, one must be patient
and persistent.</p>

<p>There is no better nerve tonic than pure air,
exercise, cheerful thoughts, and rest.</p>

<p>Sweets, fried food, rich sauces, pastry, and highly
seasoned food should be avoided.</p>

<p>When neuralgia of the stomach, due to an underlying
condition such as rheumatism, gout, or diabetes
occurs, the diet appropriate to the condition will often
affect the cure of the neuralgia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chorea</div>

<p>The diet is of the greatest importance in
this difficulty, as it is usually accompanied
by anemia. Rest and a very nourishing and easily
digested diet are essential. Sometimes a complete
rest in bed and a milk diet, or a diet composed largely
of milk, is the best means of treatment.</p>

<p>If possible the patient should be isolated and in the
care of a trained nurse who is naturally cheerful and
bright.</p>

<p>Children are especially liable to this malady. They
are usually anemic and care should be exercised that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
they be not overworked in school and that they retire
early and get from ten to twelve hours’ sleep.</p>

<p>Their eyes must be kept from strain and the nervous
system not allowed to become tense from too
much excitement, as teasing by playmates or the
family, etc.</p>

<p>They should be given the diet for Anemia on page
249.</p>


<h3><em>DIET IN SKIN DISEASES</em></h3>

<p>An improper diet or a lowered nerve tone are often
shown by the condition of the skin.</p>

<p>When the waste of the system is not being properly
eliminated through the other excretory organs the
skin is required to throw off more than its normal
amount.</p>

<p>The muddy complexion in biliousness or the congestion
of the facial capillaries in the alcoholic are familiar
examples.</p>

<p>Overeating, especially of food too rich or too concentrated,
causes fermentation from non-digestion, or
imperfect oxidation, due to too large an amount of
nutriment for the amount of oxygen furnished to
the tissues.</p>

<p>An inactive skin results in an accumulation of fat
in the sebaceous glands with clogging of the ducts;
germ infection in these clogged glands often results in
pimples and boils. An excess of acid in the secretion
of the sweat glands irritates the skin and causes
eruptions.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Chronic skin troubles are always increased and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
made more troublesome when there are errors in the
diet, and they are often benefited and in some cases
cured when the dietetic errors are corrected.</p>

<p>Skin troubles often occur when for any reason the
nervous system is run down, because the weakened
nerves cause the tissues or organs they supply to
become inactive. The skin thus becomes affected
with the rest of the body and derangements of its
function appear. Increasing nerve tone will result
in a disappearance of the skin disorders. This takes
time.</p>

<p>All rich food and highly seasoned preparations, veal,
pork, tea, coffee, pastry, too much sweets and fats,
and any fruits and vegetables that cause flatulence
should be avoided.</p>

<p>A diet of fruit, water, and Graham bread for three
or four days, every week or two, daily exercise and
deep breathing of pure air will usually clear the
skin.</p>

<p>The skin of the face is materially cleared by the use
of facial exercises which promote its activity and the
elimination of waste. Exercises for increasing the
tone of the skin and the muscles are as essential for
the face as for the body.</p>

<p>In all skin troubles alcohol must be prohibited.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Urticaria
(Hives)</div>

<p>This is characterized by distressing itching
and may be caused by any article of
food which disagrees. A more or less
irritant food or one difficult of digestion, such as
strawberries, shellfish, pork, cheese, and sausage, are
the foods which most usually produce it, if taken into
an inactive stomach. When the intestines are in a
sluggish condition the stomach does not act well, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
any food which does not digest promptly is liable to
excite an attack.</p>

<p>It is remedied, by eating very lightly, by fasting for
a day or two, by drinking <em>much</em> water, exercising,
breathing deeply, and securing activity of the bowels.
Care must be taken to avoid foods known to disagree.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Eczema</div>

<p>The cause of this disorder is often difficult
to ascertain, but it is aggravated or relapses
occur when too much or too rich food is eaten. The
skin is not able to dispose of all the material sent to it.</p>

<p>It often occurs in those who are excessive eaters of
meat.</p>

<p>The diet may have to be confined to fruit, bread and
milk, or crackers and milk for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Meat, if allowed, should be taken sparingly and not
oftener than once a day—better only every other
day. Beef and chicken are the preferable meats.
If no improvement occurs, or if it be slight, meat
should be omitted altogether. Eggs may be substituted
for meat. A little fresh fruit, if thoroughly
ripe, may be taken, but all made desserts must be
avoided and very little sweets used. Cracked wheat,
or other wheat cereal, with a little cream, may be eaten.</p>

<p>Oatmeal may provoke an attack because of the
amount of fat in it. Foods may cause an attack in
one case that have no detrimental action in another.</p>

<p>Skin eruptions, eczema-like, often occur if for any
reason the diet has been too limited, as in the semi-starvation
seen in poor children. In these cases a
more nutritious diet will often cure.</p>

<p>Bananas, apples, cabbage, or fried foods, often
cause a temporary attack or aggravate an existing
condition.</p>

<p>The food must be thoroughly masticated, must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
taken at regular times, and not in excess. As this
condition sometimes accompanies other diseases, any
underlying condition must be sought, but all diet
should be as simple as the needs of the system
will bear. The foods which are found to increase the
irritation of the skin are the ones to be avoided in
each case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pruritus
(Itching)</div>

<p>The all-prevalent American habit of
eating fried food often produces an intense
itching of the skin in various parts of the
body. It occurs often in those who eat food highly
seasoned with pepper or other condiments. The
articles of food causing the overstimulation must be
avoided, and all fried food, pastries, or food containing
much fat, must be greatly lessened or omitted
altogether.</p>

<p>Itching is sometimes caused during the change of
seasons due to the effect of the changing temperature
on the nerves of the skin. To rub the skin with oil for
two or three days to soften the dead cells and to aid
their removal from the surface will secure a better
circulation in the skin and help to eliminate the cause
of the itching. A free drinking of water, fresh air, and
exercise will help the condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Acne</div>

<p>The rapidly changing system of the
growing boy and girl is especially liable to
disorders, due to improper eating, irregular habits,
worry, lack of rest, or improper food. Eruptions,
especially on the face, appear as a result. The sebaceous
glands are especially active, and any alteration
in the structure of the blood, due to deranged
digestive processes and defective elimination by the
skin, causes too great an amount of deposit in the
fat glands. Their contents become hardened and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
infected by germs, with consequent irritation and
reddening, and the condition known as acne is the
result.</p>

<p>Once well established it is difficult to cure, but it
often rapidly improves under a simple diet, rested
nerves, cheerful, kind thoughts, and better digestion
and elimination.</p>

<p>The food should be thoroughly masticated. Young
people are prone to eat too hastily, and thus not
thoroughly mix the food with saliva. If careful
attention is paid to mastication of the food, water at
meals is an aid to digestion. Water should be taken
freely between meals, on rising and before retiring,
for its diuretic and laxative effect.</p>

<p>All candy, and sweets, hot breads, corn bread,
pastry, soups with much fat, rich hashes and sauces,
fried food, pork, and veal should be eliminated from
the diet.</p>

<p>A badly blotched face is an embarrassment, and no
restriction in the diet should be deemed a hardship
as a means to an improved digestion, increased mental
vigor, and improved health.</p>

<p>A pimple on the face should be treated as antiseptically
as a boil. The pus from a pimple which has
“come to a head” should not be allowed to infect the
surrounding skin. Infection may take place from
towels or wash cloths used by one afflicted with acne.
Care should be exercised to sterilize the surrounding
skin by peroxide of hydrogen or alcohol before a pimple
is opened and its contents should be taken up with
absorbent cotton. A pimple should never be severely
squeezed as the skin will be irritated and other pimples
may result.</p>

<p>Often the infection from one pimple is spread by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
hands or by the wash cloth. Care should be taken
to avoid this.</p>

<p><em>Exercise directed to the facial muscles and to the liver
and digestive organs, deep breathing, plenty of oxygen
by night and day, wholesome thoughts, plenty of sleep,
and simple food, will eliminate or improve most skin
difficulties. Care should be taken, by frequent bathing
and friction baths, to aid the eliminative work of the skin.</em></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Rheumatism</div>

<p>Since the medical profession is unable to
determine just what rheumatism is, it is
difficult to prescribe a diet. The theory so long believed
that it is caused by an excess of uric acid in the
system is no longer held by most of the advanced
physicians. Uric acid, however, sometimes accompanies
the disease.</p>

<p>Some authorities hold that it is a nerve difficulty;
others that it is caused by an excess of lactic acid;
others hold that it is caused by infection from the
tonsils and the gums.</p>

<p>Assuming that it is due to the failure of the system
to promptly eliminate its waste, whether this failure
to eliminate be through a weakened condition of the
nerves, and the consequent failure to properly direct
the body activities, the correction of the difficulty
must lie in building up the general vitality and in
aiding the system in its elimination.</p>

<p>Hot sweat baths, a free use of water, and a free use
of fruits and fruit juices, particularly the citrus fruits,
such as lemons, oranges, limes, etc., are desirable in
moderation, because they increase the alkalinity of the
blood, and because of their diuretic effect. Lemonade,
orangeade, and all fresh fruits and vegetables
are diuretic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>The diet should be cut down in quantity. If an
excess of uric acid exists, meat may be eliminated and
the suggestions given in the diet for Gout may be
followed.</p>

<p>The food must be plain and well cooked, not highly
seasoned, and the amount must be confined to the
needs of the system as shown by the general condition.</p>

<p>Regular exercise, until the body is thoroughly
heated, deep breathing of pure air day and night, and
a copious drinking of water are necessary.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Leanness</div>

<p>No definite diet can be given here for
flesh building, because a lack of sufficient
fat to round out the figure is due to faulty digestion
or assimilation.</p>

<p>It may be that the strength of the muscles and
nerves of the stomach, liver, and intestines should be
built up by exercises and deep breathing, and it may
be that the habit of nerve relaxation must be established.
When the nerves are tense much nourishment
is consumed in nervous energy and the nerves to
the digestive organs and muscles being disordered,
they interfere with digestion and assimilation.</p>

<p>It is apparent that the cause of the lack of flesh
must first be corrected. Merely to give a fat-building
diet may overload deranged digestive organs
with sugars, starches, and fats, further weakening
them.</p>

<p>Often leanness is due to inability to digest the
starches or sugars, and when this is the case the condition
must be remedied by strengthening the digestive
organs through exercises for the muscles of the
stomach and intestines, exercises to create a free
activity of the liver and to strengthen the nerves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
controlling digestion. Deep breathing habits to insure
sufficient oxygen to put the waste in condition
for elimination are necessary. Most often sufficient
food is eaten, but due to nerve tension or to sluggish
circulation, particularly through the vital organs, it
is not assimilated.</p>

<p>Usually, however, bodily flesh may be increased
by increasing the liquids and the carbohydrate consumption
and also the fat if these are assimilated.</p>

<p>If habits of life, overwork, improper food, unhealthy
thoughts, nerve exhaustion, excessive nerve tension,
or disease are responsible, they must first be corrected.
Often the nerve tension must be relaxed by change
of habit of both body and mind before the flesh will
accumulate.</p>

<p>There must be no mental strain, and plenty of sleep
must be secured.</p>

<p>If they can be assimilated, the diet should contain
soups, butter, milk, cream, cocoa, chocolate, well-cooked
cereals, as oatmeal, bread, tapioca, or rice
puddings with cream and sugar, bread, potatoes,
leguminous foods, as peas and beans, cake, honey,
especially sweet fruits, carrots, parsnips, and other
vegetables; meat not oftener than once a day.</p>

<p>Vinegar and too much spice, pastry, coffee, and tea
should be avoided.</p>

<p>The free drinking of liquid is most important.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Obesity</div>

<p>Obesity is caused by a disturbed balance
of nutrition occasioned, often, by more food
being taken than the body requires. The resultant
fat is deposited in and among the tissues.</p>

<p>It is most often seen in those in middle life of sedentary
habit who continue to eat as heartily as ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
without using a little thought to determine the actual
body needs for food.</p>

<p>An excess of fat is often seen in light eaters, however.
This is usually due to a weakness of nerve
tissue, which does not direct the regular activities of
the body—digestion assimilation, elimination, etc.—with
sufficient force to burn up the normal amount
of fat in automatic activities.</p>

<p>In all cases breathing is usually faulty, oxidation is
incomplete, and little exercise for the vital organs is
taken. Anemia may exist in such individuals.</p>

<p>The body fat is formed from various elements in
foods, and a food which may cause obesity in one
individual may not produce it in another. Fat
meats, alcoholic drinks, or the excessive use of starches
and sugars may cause it. The food at fault in each
case must be determined and largely reduced or
eliminated from the diet.</p>

<p>Many obesity cures are in existence, and have had
considerable vogue from time to time. Anti-fat
remedies are dangerous, as they lower the vitality of
the system and render it liable to be attacked by disease.
All such remedies act by decreasing the appetite
and causing impairment of the digestion.</p>

<p>The rational method is to limit both the amount of
food and the liquid to be taken, to increase oxidation
by deep breathing and exercise. By restricting the
carbohydrates and fats consumed the body calls on
that stored in the tissues. In obesity, unless there
is an underlying condition of disease, the amount of
water should be limited while reducing and none
should be drunk with the meals. Soup, milk, and
all juicy fruits and all foods made from cereals should
be taken sparingly; sugar must usually be forbidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
and fat in the food limited to a little butter. One
need not starve under this treatment for the diet may
be varied enough to prevent monotony even though
restricted.</p>

<p>Fresh green vegetables, fruit, and lean meat should
form the main ingredients of the diet, but if gastric
disturbances arise the diet must be varied to correct
them. Meat should be eaten but once a day.</p>

<p>Extremes in diet should be strictly avoided; a sudden
restriction of diet produces changes in the blood
which may do harm. For this reason the amount of
food taken should be gradually but steadily reduced
and one article after another eliminated until the
system becomes accustomed to the reduction.</p>

<p><em>Thorough elimination must be secured through
exercise and deep breathing.</em></p>

<p>All alcoholic liquors must be omitted.</p>

<p><em>All diets for obesity must be prescribed for the individual
condition. A diet suited to one person may
be entirely unsuited to another. For this reason, and
because of the danger of one following a diet which
may be unsuited to the condition, diets for obesity are
not given here.</em></p>

<p><em>Exercise and deep breathing must constitute an appreciable
part of reduction methods to cause a combustion
of the fat liberated.</em> These are the natural, scientific
means of reduction.</p>

<p><em>If one reduces by diet alone the excess of fat may not
come from the part desired.</em> One is likely to show the
results first in the face and neck. One should exercise
the parts desired to be reduced so as to oxidize
the fat stored about these particular tissues.</p>

<p>A large number of the obese are afflicted with rheumatism,
sluggish livers, sluggish action of the intestines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
and weak nerves, and the diet must be governed
accordingly.</p>

<p>The regulation of food for reduction of flesh must
also be governed by age, sex, by the manner of breathing,
and by the amount of daily exercise. The food
must be regulated in accordance with the quantity of
carbohydrates and fats daily consumed in heat and
energy.</p>

<p>A rational study of the needs of the system and a
persistent following of the indicated regimen will result
in a steady reduction, renewed vitality, and a sense of
“being fit.” The better elimination secured by exercise
and increased oxygen will aid the muscles to release
the fat which may have caused them to become
flabby.</p>

<p>Reduction must not be accomplished too suddenly,
but it can be gained by a little self-denial and determination.</p>

<p>One who carries too much fat is much more liable to
gout, rheumatism, apoplexy, high blood pressure,
asthma, and bronchial affections.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Feeding
the Convalescent</div>

<p>When an individual is recovering from
an illness the appetite often becomes
excessively active, and his demands for
food, if yielded to by the family or attendant,
may produce digestive derangements from which
recovery is slow.</p>

<p>On the other hand, too much food is often urged on
the convalescent from a mistaken idea that large
quantities of food are necessary in order to rebuild
the enfeebled system.</p>

<p>Care must be taken not to return too rapidly to a
solid diet when a liquid diet has been followed for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
time. The digestive system shares in the general
weakness and must not be overloaded.</p>

<p>The more easily digested foods, as ice cream, milk,
tapioca, crackers and cream or cream toast, cream
soups and meat broths thickened with bread crumbs
rolled from toasted bread, custards, stewed fruits,
corn meal, mush, in some conditions, cornstarch blancmange,
boiled rice, and poached eggs may be given.</p>

<p>Later, when meat is added to the diet it should be
scraped or finely minced so as to give the stomach as
little work as possible until it regains its tone.</p>

<p>Potatoes, if allowed, should be baked or mashed.</p>

<p>Sweetbreads in cream, sponge cake or lady fingers
with light cream may also be allowed.</p>

<p>At least a week should be taken in returning to a
solid diet and the orders of the physician must be
strictly followed. Pickles, nuts, or solid meats should
not be allowed. They will often occasion a return of
fever and possibly a relapse.</p>

<p>After typhoid fever or other lingering illness, the
appetite is usually much increased, but great care must
be exercised not to allow solid food before the condition
of the stomach and intestines shows that danger
is past. It is usual not to allow solid food in typhoid
fever for two weeks after the fever has disappeared.</p>

<p>It is possible to make great variety in the diet even
if it be light and easily digested and common sense
must govern in the kind as well as the quantity of
food allowed the convalescent.</p>

<p>Scraped beef or scraped chicken may be seasoned,
lightly pan broiled, and made into a sandwich. The
first solid meat may be creamed sweetbread, a bit of
broiled tenderloin steak, or breast of chicken.</p>

<p>It is better to give small amounts both because of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
the lessened work of digestion and because large
amounts of food often destroy rather than aid the
appetite.</p>

<p>If the appetite is capricious, or lacking, it needs to be
stimulated by food appetizingly prepared and daintily
served. A sloppy tray with half-cold tea or coffee
will often cause complete loss of appetite.</p>

<p>The face and hands of an invalid should always be
bathed before a meal; the fresh feeling induced is often
an aid to the appetite. The mouth should be carefully
cleansed after eating in order that no fermenting food
particles may be carried into the stomach to cause
disturbance there. Swabbing the mouth with cotton
dipped in an alkaline wash or rinsing the mouth with
listerine and water or peroxide of hydrogen and water
will add greatly to the comfort of the sick, especially
when the tongue is coated and the mouth bitter.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken not to allow bread
crumbs to fall into or under the bedclothes, as a
small bread crumb is often a source of great discomfort.
The skin is especially sensitive and a small bread
crumb may so disturb the mind as to cause a patient,
otherwise doing well, to become restless and disturbed.</p>

<p>The invalid frequently forgets to ask for water and
the attendant should see that a sufficient amount of
water is taken. A glass of water should be placed
where it is within easy reach and it should not be
allowed to become warm. Cool water is one of the
prime requisites in the invalid’s dietary.</p>

<span class="fs80">RECIPES FOR FOODS FOR INVALIDS AND SEMI-INVALIDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> purpose is not to give such recipes as are
found in ordinary cookbooks, but simply to
suggest foods useful for invalids, for semi-invalids, or
for chronic, abnormal conditions of digestive organs.</p>

<p><em>Water.</em> Pure and carbonated; mineral waters containing
iron, sulphur, lithium, etc.</p>

<p>Hot drinks should be served at a temperature of
from 122 to 140 degrees F. When water is used as a
hot drink it should be freshly drawn, brought to a
boil, and used at once. This sterilizes and develops
a better flavor.</p>

<p>Cold water should be thoroughly cooled, but not
iced, unless ice water is sipped very slowly and held
in the mouth until the chill is off. Water is best
cooled by placing the receptacle on ice rather than by
putting ice in the water.</p>

<p><em>Fruit Juices.</em> Under fruit juices are: grape juice,
apple juice, currant juice, pineapple juice, orangeade,
and lemonade.</p>

<p>They are especially grateful to fever patients and
are often used to stimulate the appetite. They are
particularly valuable for the acids which they contain,
which aid the action of the kidneys and the peristaltic
action of the digestive tract; they also increase the
alkalinity of the blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>Apples contain malic acid, lemons citric acid, and
grapes tartaric acid. The ferment in the ripe pineapple
juice aids in the digestion of proteins.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p><em>Lemonade.</em> Wash and wipe a lemon. Cut a slice from the
middle into two pieces to be used in the garnish before serving;
then squeeze the juice of the rest of the lemon into a bowl, keeping
back the seeds. Add sugar and boiling water; cover and put
on ice to cool; strain and pour into a glass.</p>

<p><em>Fruit Lemonade.</em> To change and vary the flavor, fresh fruit of
all kinds may be added to strong lemonade, using boiling water
as directed above.</p>

<p><em>Egg Lemonade.</em> Beat an egg thoroughly, add 2 tablespoonfuls
of sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, and gradually pour in one
cup of cold water. Stir until smooth and well mixed. Serve
thoroughly cold. This drink is very easily digested, the lemon
having partly digested the egg; 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry or port
may be added.</p>

<p><em>Bran Lemonade.</em> Mix one-quarter cup of wheat bran with 2
cups of cold water. Allow this to stand overnight and in the
morning add the juice of a lemon.</p>

<p><em>Pineapple Lemonade.</em> Mix one-half cup of grated pineapple
with the juice of 1 lemon and 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar; add one-half
cup of boiling water, put on ice until cool, then add 1 cup of
ice-cold water. Strain and serve.</p>

<p><em>Grape Lemonade.</em> To 1 cup of lemonade, made as directed
above, rather sweet, add one-half cup of grape juice.</p>

<p><em>Effervescing Lemonade.</em> To the juice of 1 large lemon add a
lump or two of sugar which has been rubbed on the rind.
Pour on it half a pint of cold or ice water. Add half a teaspoonful
of bicarbonate of soda after it has been placed in the
tumbler.</p>

<p><em>Orangeade.</em> One orange, 1 teaspoonful of sugar, three-quarters
of a coffee cup of water. Wash and wipe the orange. Squeeze
the juice into the sugar. Add the cold water which has previously
been boiled. Strain.</p>

<p><em>Apple Water.</em> Slice 1 pound of apples, put in a jar with one-fourth
of a pound of brown sugar. Pour over apples and sugar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
1 gallon of boiling water. When cool put the apples through a
colander. Bottle but do not cork. Keep in a cool place. May
be poured over toasted bread.</p>

<p><em>Mixed Fruit Drink.</em> Mix one-quarter cup of grated pineapple,
the juice of half a lemon, the juice of half an orange, 1 cup
of boiling water, and sugar to taste. Put on the ice until cool.
Strain and add more cold water and sugar according to taste.</p>

<p><em>Pineapple Juice.</em> Pour one-half cup of pineapple juice over
crushed ice and serve in a dainty glass. This is especially helpful
in cases of weak digestion and in some throat troubles—as stated
above, the pineapple aids protein digestion.</p>

<p><em>Lemon Whey.</em> Heat 1 cup of milk in a small saucepan, over
hot water, or in a double boiler. Add 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon
juice; cook without stirring until the whey separates. Strain
through cheesecloth and add two teaspoonfuls of sugar. Serve
hot or cold. Garnish with small pieces of lemon.</p>

<p><em>Wine Whey</em> may be made in the same way, using one-quarter
cup of sherry wine to 1 cup of hot milk.</p>

<p><em>Grape Juice, Apple Juice, and Currant Juice</em> are tonics and make
a dainty variety for the sick room. They should be used according
to their strength, usually about one-third juice to two-thirds
water. They should be kept cold and tightly corked until
ready to serve.</p>

<p><em>Grape Lithia.</em> Add 4 ounces of Lithia-water to 1 ounce of
grape juice and 2 teaspoonfuls of sugar.</p>

<p><em>Grape Nectar.</em> Boil together 1 pound of sugar and one-half
pint of water until it begins to thread. Remove from the fire
and when cool add the juice of 6 lemons and 1 quart of grape
juice. Let stand overnight. Serve with ice water, Apollinaris,
or plain soda water.</p>

<p><em>Tea Punch.</em> Pour boiling lemonade, sweetened to taste, over
tea leaves. Allow the liquid to stand until cool. Then strain
and serve with shaved ice and slices of lemon. This makes a
delicious cooling drink for hot weather.</p>

<h3>LIQUID FOOD</h3>

<p>Under this heading such liquids are given as are
actual foods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p><em>Milk.</em> Milk is a complete food and a perfect
food for infants, but not a perfect food for adults.
It may be used as</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Whole or skimmed;<br>
Peptonized; boiled;<br>
Sterilized; pasteurized;<br>
Milk with lime water, Vichy or Apollinaris;<br>
With equal parts of farinaceous liquids;<br>
Albuminized milk with white of egg;<br>
Milk with egg yolk, flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, or nutmeg;<br>
Milk flavored with coffee, cocoa, or meat broth;<br>
Milk punch; milk lemonade;<br>
Kumyss; kefir or whey, with lemon juice, as above.<br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p><em>Milk and Cinnamon.</em> Boil in one pint of new milk sufficient
cinnamon to flavor it and sweeten with white sugar.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Egg Preparations.</em> These consist of:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
Albumin water (diluted white of egg), flavored with fruit juice;<br>
Egg lemonade; egg orangeade;<br>
Egg with meat broth;<br>
Egg with coffee and milk;<br>
Chocolate eggnog.<br>
</p>

<p>Often the white of egg, dissolved in water or milk,
is given when the yolk cannot be digested because of
the amount of fat which it contains.</p>

<p>When one is inclined to biliousness, the egg is better
digested if beaten in wine.</p>

<p>The albuminous or egg drinks are best prepared
cold.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p><em>Eggnog.</em> To make eggnog, separate the white and the yolk,
beat the yolk with three-quarters of a tablespoonful of sugar and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
a speck of salt until creamy. Add three-quarters of a cup of milk
and 1 tablespoonful of brandy. Beat the white until foamy, add
to the above mixture, and serve immediately. A little nutmeg
may be substituted for the brandy. The eggs and milk should be
chilled before using. Eggnog is very nutritious.</p>

<p><em>Egg Broth.</em> Beat the yolk of 1 egg, add 1 tablespoonful of sugar
and a speck of salt. Add 1 cup of hot milk and pour it on gradually.
Flavor with nutmeg.</p>

<p>Dried and rolled bread crumbs may be added, or beef, mutton,
or chicken broth may be used in place of the milk, and the sugar
may be omitted. The whole egg may be used if desired.</p>

<p>This is very delicious made with beef broth, instead of hot
milk. Pineapple juice or coffee may be used.</p>

<p><em>Coffee Eggnog.</em> 1 egg, 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> teaspoons of sugar, one-half scant
cup of milk or cream, one-half scant cup of coffee.</p>

<p><em>Egg Malted Milk.</em> Mix 1 tablespoonful of Horlick’s Malted
Milk with 1 tablespoonful of crushed fruit and 1 egg; beat for
five minutes. Strain and add 20 drops of acid phosphate, 1
tablespoonful of crushed ice, and three-quarters cup of ice water.
A grating of nutmeg may be used for flavor.</p>

<p><em>Grape Yolk.</em> Separate the white and the yolk of an egg, beat
the yolk, add the sugar, and let the yolk and sugar stand while the
white of the egg is thoroughly whipped. Add 2 tablespoonfuls
of grape juice to the yolk and pour this on to the beaten white,
blending carefully. Have all ingredients chilled before blending
and serve cold.</p>

<p><em>Albuminized Milk.</em> Beat one-half cup of milk and the white of
1 egg with a few grains of salt. Put into a fruit jar, shake thoroughly
until blended. Strain into a glass and serve cold.</p>

<p><em>White Wine Whey.</em> To half a pint of milk boiling add 1 wineglassful
of sherry. Strain through a cheesecloth. Sweeten with
powdered sugar to taste. For a child give a tablespoonful every
2 or 3 hours.</p>

<p><em>Albumin Water.</em> Albumin water is used chiefly for infants in
cases of acute stomach and intestinal disorders, in which some
nutritious and easily assimilated food is needed. The white of
1 egg is beaten and mixed with a pint of water, which has been
boiled and cooled.</p>

<p><em>Albuminized Grape Juice.</em> Put 2 tablespoonfuls of grape juice
into a dainty glass with pure chopped ice. Beat the white of 1 egg,
turn into the glass, sprinkle a little sugar over the top, and serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p><em>Cream of Tartar Water.</em> Dissolve a teaspoonful or a teaspoonful
and a half of cream of tartar in a pint of boiling water,
flavor with lemon peel and sugar. Strain and drink when cold.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Farinaceous Beverages.</em> These are all made by
slowly cooking cereals, such as barley, rice, oatmeal,
etc., in a large quantity of boiling water from two to
three hours, straining off the liquid, and seasoning to
taste. They are particularly valuable when only a
small amount of nutriment can be assimilated. Since
the chief ingredient is starch, long cooking is necessary
to make soluble the starch globules, so that it can be
more readily digested. Since these drinks are given
only in case of weak digestion, it is important that
they be taken slowly and held in the mouth until they
are thoroughly mixed with the saliva.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p><em>Barley Water</em> (Infant feeding). Mix 1 teaspoonful of barley
flour with 2 tablespoonfuls of cold water, until it is a smooth paste.
Put in the top of a double boiler and add gradually 1 pint of
boiling water. Boil over direct heat five minutes, stirring constantly;
then put into a double boiler, over boiling water, and cook
fifteen minutes longer. This is used as a milk diluent for normal
infants and to check diarrhea.</p>

<p>For children or adults use one-half teaspoonful of barley or
rice flour, 1 cup of boiling water, and one-quarter teaspoonful of
salt. Cream or milk and salt may be added for adults, or, lemon
juice and sugar, according to the condition.</p>

<p>Barley water is an astringent and used to check the bowels
when they are too loose.</p>

<p><em>Barley Water</em> (Bartholow). Wash 2 ounces of pearl barley with
cold water. Then boil it for five minutes in some fresh water and
throw both waters away. Then pour on 2 quarts of boiling water
and boil it down to a quart. Stir and skim occasionally. Flavor
with lemon rind. Add sugar to taste but do not strain unless
the patient requests it.</p>

<p><em>Rice Water or Mucilage of Rice.</em> Thoroughly wash 1 ounce of
rice with cold water. Then soak for three hours in a quart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
water kept at a tepid heat, stirring from time to time, and afterwards
boil slowly for an hour and strain. This is useful in dysentery,
diarrhea, and irritable states of the alimentary canal. It
may be sweetened and flavored in the same way as barley water.</p>

<p><em>Flaxseed Tea.</em> One-half cupful of flaxseed to 1 quart of boiling
water. Boil thirty minutes and let stand near the fire to thicken.
Strain, add lemon juice and sugar to taste.</p>

<p><em>Rice Water.</em> Wash 2 tablespoonfuls of rice, add 3 cups of cold
water, and soak thirty minutes. Then heat gradually and cook
one hour until the rice is tender. Strain through muslin, reheat,
and dilute with boiling water or hot milk to the consistency
desired. Season with salt; sugar may be added if desired and cinnamon,
if allowed, may be cooked with it as a flavor. One teaspoonful
of stoned raisins may be added to the rice, before boiling,
if there is no bowel trouble.</p>

<p><em>Oatmeal Water.</em> Mix 1 tablespoonful of oatmeal with 1 tablespoonful
of cold water. Add a speck of salt and stir into it a
quart of boiling water. Boil for three hours, replenishing the
water as it boils away. Strain though a fine sieve or cheesecloth,
season, and serve cold. Sufficient water should be added
to keep the drink almost as thin as water.</p>

<p><em>Toast Water.</em> Toast thin slices of stale bread in the oven;
break up into crumbs; add 1 cup of boiling water and let it stand
for an hour. Rub through a fine strainer, season with a little
salt. Milk, or cream and sugar may be added if desirable. This
is valuable in cases of fever or extreme nausea.</p>

<p><em>Sago Soup.</em> Stew 2 ounces of the best sago in a pint of water
until it is quite tender. Mix with half a pint of good boiling
cream and the yolks of two fresh eggs. Put into it 1 quart of
essence of beef. Mix thoroughly. The beef essence must be
heated separately and mixed while both mixtures are hot. This
must be served warm.</p>

<p><em>Crust Coffee.</em> Dry crusts of brown bread in the oven until they
are hard and crisp. Pound or roll them and pour boiling water
over. Let soak for fifteen minutes, then strain carefully through
a fine sieve.</p>
</div>


<h3><em>MEAT JUICES</em></h3>

<p>Meat juice may be prepared in three ways:</p>

<p>(1) Broil quickly, or even scorch, a small piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
beef. Squeeze out the juice with a lemon squeezer,
previously dipped in boiling water. Catch the juice
in a hot cup. Season and serve. If desirable to heat
it further, place the cup in hot water.</p>

<p>(2) Broil quickly, cut up and put the small pieces
into a glass jar. Set the covered jar in a pan of cold
water. Heat gradually for an hour, never allowing
the water to come to a boil. Strain and press out the
clear, red juice, season, and serve. One pound of beef
yields 8 tablespoonfuls of juice.</p>

<p>(3) Grind raw beef and place in a lightly covered
jar with 1 gill of cold water to a pound of beef.
Stand it on ice overnight and squeeze through a bag.
Strain, season, and serve.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p><em>Meat Tea.</em> Meat tea is made by using a pound of meat to a
pint of water. Grind the meat, place in a jar, and cover with the
cold water. Set the jar in an open kettle of water and cook for
two hours or more, not allowing the water to boil. Strain by
squeezing through a bag, skim off the fat, and season.</p>

<p><em>Meat Broth.</em> Meat broth is made from meat and bone, with or
without vegetables. The proportion is a quart of water to a
pound of meat. Cut the meat into small pieces, add the cold
water, and simmer until the quantity is reduced one-half. Strain,
skim, and season with salt. Chicken, veal, mutton, and beef may
be used in this way. It may be seasoned with onions, celery,
bay-leaves, cloves, carrots, parsnips, rice, barley, or tapioca.
Stale bread crumbs may be added.</p>

<p><em>Mutton and Chicken Broth.</em> Cut up a chicken or a pound of
mutton, because it is free from fat, put into cold water to cover,
and let stand on ice two or three hours. Cook over a slow fire
until the meat falls from the bone. Strain, cool, skim off the
fat, salt to taste, and allow to cool. This may be served hot or
cold.</p>

<p><em>Broth for the Sick.</em> To 1 pound of chopped lean meat of any
kind, except pork or veal, add 1 pint of cold water or one pint
and a half on ice. Let stand in a covered glass fruit jar for from
four to six hours, cook for three hours in a closed jar placed in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
kettle of water, strain, cool, skim off the fat, clear with a beaten
egg, season to taste. This may be given warm or cold.</p>

<p><em>Beef Tea and Oatmeal.</em> Two tablespoonfuls of oatmeal and 2
of cold water, mix thoroughly. Add a pint of good beef tea which
has been brought to the boiling point. Boil together for five
minutes. The oatmeal must have been previously cooked for a
long time. It may be taken from that prepared for the morning
meal.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><em>Soups.</em> Clear soups are made by cooking raw meat or vegetables,
or both together, slowly, for a long time, then straining
the liquid. The flavor may be changed by browning the meat
or vegetables in butter before adding the water.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Cream soups are made in the proportion of 1 quart of vegetables
(such as corn, peas, beans, tomatoes, celery, or asparagus)
to 1 pint of water and adding 1 pint of milk. Cook the vegetables
thoroughly in water and mash through a colander. To this
water and pulp add a cream sauce made in the proportion of 4
tablespoonfuls of flour, 4 tablespoonfuls of butter, and 1 pint of
milk, for vegetables poor in starch or protein. Add 2 tablespoonfuls
of flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, and a pint of milk for
those rich in protein. Season to taste.</p>

<p>Tomato acid should be counteracted by the addition of one-eighth
tablespoonful of soda before the milk is added.</p>

<p>Potato soup may be flavored with onion or celery, or both.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a) Milk gruels.</p>
<p>(b) Water gruels.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br>

<p><em>Jellies.—Meat Jellies</em> are made in two ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>(1) Cook soup meat (containing gristle and bone) slowly
for a long time in just enough water to cover. Strain and set the
liquid away in a mold to cool and set. If desired, bits of shredded
meat may be added to the liquid before molding.</p>

<p>(2) Use meat broth and gelatin in the proportion of 1 tablespoon
gelatin to three-quarters of a cup of hot broth. Pour
into mold and set on ice.</p>

<p><em>Starch Jellies.</em> Starch jellies are made by cooking in a pint of
fruit juice or water until clear, 2 tablespoonfuls of tapioca, arrowroot,
sago, cornstarch, or flour. Sweeten to taste.</p>

<p>If water is used, fresh fruit may be used either in the jelly or
in a sauce poured over the jelly.</p>

<p><em>Fruit Jellies.</em> These are made:</p>

<p>(1) Of fruit juice and sugar in equal quantities, cooked until
it will set when cooled;</p>

<p>(2) Of fruit juice and gelatin in the proportion of 1 tablespoon
of gelatin to three-fourths of a cup of fruit juice, or one-half
box gelatin to 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> pints of juice. Sugar to taste. Made
tea or coffee, or cocoa or lemonade may be used in the same
proportion.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Custards.</em> These are made with (1) milk, (2) milk
and eggs, (3) milk, egg, and some farinaceous substances
as rice, cornstarch, tapioca. In the first the
coagulum is produced by the addition of rennet, in the
other two by the application of heat.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p><em>Plain Junket.</em> Dissolve in a cup of lukewarm milk (never
warmer), a tablespoon of sugar or caramel syrup. Add a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
quarter of a junket tablet, previously dissolved in a tablespoon
of cold water. Stir a few times, add vanilla, nuts, or nutmeg if
desired. Pour into a cup and set aside to cool and solidify.
This may be served plain or with whipped cream, or boiled
custard.</p>

<p><em>Egg-Milk Custard.</em> When eggs are used for thickening, not
less than four eggs should be used to a quart of milk (more eggs
make it richer).</p>

<p><em>Snowballs.</em> Heat 1 pint of milk with sugar to taste. Beat the
whites of 3 eggs stiff, then beat in 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> tablespoonfuls of powdered
sugar. Drop by spoonfuls into the hot milk, turn in three minutes,
and take out. Beat yolks of the eggs, pour the hot milk
over them, and allow to thicken. Do not boil. Arrange snowballs
in dish and pour custard over. Serve cool.</p>

<p><em>Boiled Custard.</em> One pint of milk, 2 eggs, one-half cup of
sugar, one-half saltspoon of salt. Scald the milk, add the salt
and sugar, and stir until dissolved. Beat the eggs very thick and
smooth. Pour the boiling milk on the eggs slowly, stirring all the
time. Pour the mixture into a double boiler, set over the fire,
and stir for ten minutes. Add flavoring. As soon as a thickening
of the mixture is noticed remove from the fire, pour into a dish, and
set away to cool. This custard makes <em>cup custard</em>, the sauce for
such puddings as <em>snow pudding</em>, and when decorated with spoonfuls
of beaten egg-white, makes <em>floating island</em>.</p>

<p><em>Baked Custard.</em> Proceed as in boiled custard, but instead of
pouring into a double boiler pour into a baking dish. Set the
dish in a pan of water, place in the oven, and bake until the mixture
is set in the middle.</p>

<p><em>Farinaceous Custards.</em> Make like boiled custard, using one
less egg and adding one-quarter cup of farina, tapioca, cornstarch,
arrowroot, or cooked rice to the hot milk and egg.</p>

<p><em>Sago</em> should be soaked overnight before using.</p>

<p><em>Tapioca</em> should be soaked one hour before using.</p>

<p><em>Coffee Custard.</em> Scald one tablespoon of ground coffee in milk
and strain before proceeding as for boiled custard.</p>

<p><em>Chocolate Custard.</em> Add one square of grated chocolate to the
milk.</p>

<p><em>Caramel Custard.</em> Melt the dry sugar until golden brown, add
the hot milk, and when dissolved proceed as before. Bake.</p>

<p><em>Milk for Puddings or Stewed Fruit</em> (Ringer). Boil a small piece
of lemon rind and 2 cloves in a pint of milk. Mix half a teaspoonful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
of arrowroot in a little cold milk and add it to the boiled milk.
Stir until about the consistency of cream. Beat up the yolks
of 3 eggs in a little milk. Beat into the hot milk taken off the
fire and as it cools add the eggs and a tablespoonful of orange
flower water, stirring it constantly until quite cool. Keep in a
very cool place until required for use.</p>

<p><em>Bread Jelly.</em> Pour boiling water on stale bread and allow it
to soak until soft. Pour off the water, add fresh water to cover,
and boil until stiff and until it becomes jelly-like when it cools.
It may be eaten with milk or cream.</p>

<span class="fs80">INFANT FEEDING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> of the fundamental problems of to-day, as it
was of yesterday and will be of to-morrow, is
the correct feeding of infants and children.</p>

<p>Every civilized country faces the same problem,
largely because the artificial feeding of infants has
become so prevalent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many women who must labor outside
of the home must resort partially, if not entirely,
to artificial feeding of their infants. Usually on account
of the inconvenience of breast feeding and the
strain on the mother, the infant is given artificial
food, often improperly prepared. Although infant
mortality is high among the poorer classes, it is marvelous
that so many of these infants survive.</p>

<p>It is an encouraging fact, however, that women
among the well-to-do and educated classes are appreciating
the importance of breast feeding and that the
number of these who are not only willing but anxious
to nurse their infants is increasing.</p>

<p>The mother should be firm in her decision to nurse
her child and be encouraged to persevere in efforts to
secure the proper development of the breasts before
the birth of the child, that the quantity as well as the
quality of the milk may be adequate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>The fact that nearly one-fourth of the civilized race
dies during the first year of life is astounding. This
mortality is due directly or indirectly to nutritional
disturbances that could in a great measure be prevented
if the babies were properly nursed at the breast
or if the artificial feeding was carefully regulated.</p>

<p>Of six hundred and forty-one infants under observation
by Dublin, in Fall River, Mass., five hundred
and sixty-five were breast-fed and seventy-six bottle-fed.
After the first week there were one hundred and
six deaths. In seventy-four of these the infants were
breast-fed, and in thirty-two, bottle-fed; nearly one-half
of the bottle-fed babies died and only 10 per cent.
of the breast-fed babies. The breast-fed child, therefore,
has five chances to live where the bottle-fed child
has one.</p>

<p>One fundamental principle on which all of the leading
specialists in the study of the baby agree, is that
the milk of the healthy mother is the only ideal baby
food. Every mother should be made to realize the
importance of nursing her baby for at least nine or
ten months, unless circumstances beyond control make
it impossible or inadvisable.</p>

<p>Proper care of the breasts and of the general health
during the expectant period will usually secure a
sufficient flow of milk for the child’s needs.</p>

<p>The mental attitude of the mother has much to do
with the secretion of milk; therefore she should cultivate
the habit of kindly, cheerful, healthful thoughts.
She should keep her circulation and vitality up to par.</p>

<p>She should take regular exercise and be out in the
fresh air daily.</p>

<p>During the first two or three days the child receives
little nourishment from the breast, simply a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
ounces daily of a yellowish substance known as colostrum,
which is supposed to have a laxative effect on
its bowels.</p>

<p>It is, however, usual to put the child to the breast
at regular intervals of about four hours after the first
day, to stimulate the milk secretion, which should be
quite free on the third day; it, however, may be slow
in coming for a day to two longer.</p>

<p>A teaspoonful or two of warm boiled water, or of a
five per cent. solution of milk-sugar may be given
every few hours, in fact it is considered advisable by
some physicians, in order to lessen somewhat the loss
in weight which takes place during the first week.</p>

<p>If the free flow of milk is delayed beyond forty-eight
hours, some nourishment must be given. A little
modified cow’s milk is best. The preparation of this
will be taken up under Artificial Feeding.</p>

<p>The mother should not permit herself to become
easily discouraged about her ability to nurse her
child, for even though the supply at first seems very
deficient and it is necessary to give the baby other
nourishment, it should be put to the breast at regular
intervals, as the sucking by the child stimulates the
secretion of milk. The flow of milk often increases
when the mother becomes more active.</p>

<p>When the milk flows freely, the contents of one
breast is sufficient for one nursing, and the breasts
should be used alternately, that is one breast at one
feeding and the other at the next.</p>

<p>Nursing should not last longer than from ten to
twenty minutes. Too rapid nursing is apt to cause
vomiting. If it is necessary to check the flow of milk
somewhat, it can be done by pressing the breast
slightly between the fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>There is a warmth, a purity, and a vitality to the
mother’s milk that is impossible to secure in any artificial
food no matter how carefully and skilfully prepared.
It is also germ-free.</p>

<p>Some women seem unable to nurse their babies for
more than two or three months and it is sometimes
thought that it is not worth while for a woman to nurse
her baby unless she can do so for a considerable time.
This, however, is a great mistake, because there is no
time in the baby’s life when it is more important for it
to have breast milk than in the beginning. This is
the time when the baby’s digestion is most easily disturbed
and most difficult to correct. Every day or
week that a baby gets breast milk gives it a better
start.</p>

<p>It has been thought that it is dangerous to use both
breast and artificial feeding. This idea is erroneous.
The artificial food cannot make the breast milk hard
to digest, while the breast feeding seems to make the
artificial food digest more readily. This may be due
in part to the ferments which the breast milk contains,
but more probably is due to the fact that the baby is
able to utilize the proteins of human milk to build
tissue when it cannot so readily utilize the proteins of
the artificial food.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Wet
Nursing</div>

<p>Wet nursing is resorted to less frequently
now than in the past on account of better
methods for artificial feeding.</p>

<p>If the mother is unable to nurse the child herself
and the conditions are ideal, that is the wet nurse a
healthy, happy woman with a thriving baby of her
own, and very particular in the care of her person, this
is better than artificial feeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel">Contra-Indications
to Nursing</div>

<p>Total absence of milk, after earnest
efforts to stimulate its secretion necessitates
artificial feeding.</p>

<p>If the mother has chorea, epilepsy, or
tuberculosis in any form, it is best to resort to artificial
feeding; also if the mother has syphilis and the baby
is free from it. In these conditions the child must
often be taken from the mother to avoid infection.</p>

<p>If the mother has had serious complications in pregnancy
or parturition, the physician must decide on the
advisability of natural or artificial feeding.</p>

<p>In case of nephritis, except perhaps in a very mild
form, the milk is toxic and therefore nursing from the
breast should be prohibited.</p>

<p>Sometimes in acute contagious disease it is safer to
nurse the baby than to subject it to the dangers of
artificial food. However, when the mother’s temperature
exceeds 101 or 102 degrees, the milk will probably
possess toxic qualities and disagree with the
infant.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Anatomy
and Physiology
of the
Infant</div>

<p>Every nursing mother should acquaint
herself with the process of the infant’s
digestion, as many of the infantile difficulties
are caused by overfeeding or underfeeding,
due to ignorance on this subject.</p>

<p>The alimentary tract of the new-born infant
differs in many ways from that of the adult.</p>

<p>As compared with other mammals, the human infant
is the most helpless and undeveloped and therefore
the most delicate and easily affected. It is practically
dependent on its mother for nourishment which will
completely supply its needs.</p>

<p>The capacity of the stomach, after careful study,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
has been placed at from 1 to 2 ounces at birth, 2 to
3 ounces at the end of the first month, 6 ounces at the
6th month, and from 9 to 10 ounces at the end of the
first year. This is simply an average guide, as stomachs
vary somewhat in size. Quantities somewhat
larger than the foregoing are sometimes fed, but some
of the food has passed beyond the pylorus before the
last of it is taken. Digestion begins as soon as the
food enters the stomach.</p>

<p>The secretion of bile begins within 12 hours after
birth, increases rapidly, and is fully established within
a week or ten days.</p>

<p>The pancreatic ferments which digest starches and
sugar are present in the new-born, although scanty;
the sucking movements of the child when nursing
exercise the salivary glands so that saliva is secreted;
but starch digestion is not completed in the mouth,
hence starch and a greater proportion of sugar than is
in the mother’s milk are difficult for the infant to digest.</p>

<p>The intestines, when compared with the length of
the body, are relatively long in infants, but the muscular
coat is comparatively weak; digestion is therefore
relatively slow and more subject to derangement by
substances that influence peristalsis.</p>

<p>The fact that infants vomit with comparatively
little effort, the food overflowing from an overloaded
stomach, is due to the relatively feeble closure of the
cardiac orifice.</p>

<p>The stomach contents are kept germ-free by the
secretion of hydrochloric acid and the upper intestine
is nearly free from bacteria in breast-fed infants,
because of the antibacterial nature of the intestinal
secretion. In some digestive disturbances this safeguard
fails and bacteria develop rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel">Intestinal
Disturbances</div>

<p>Intestinal disturbance in the breast-fed
infant is most often caused by overfeeding,
the infant often nursing too frequently,
thereby emptying the breasts and securing
a high fat ratio. Frequent nursing does not give the
stomach time to empty and thus digestive disturbances
are apt to occur. Therefore, as a means of relieving
intestinal trouble in the infant, nursing at regular
intervals and not too frequently, is of much
importance.</p>

<p>When digestive disturbance has occurred it is
best to stop nursing for twenty-four hours, giving the
infant weak barley gruel sweetened with saccharin.
At the end of twenty-four hours let the infant nurse
at the breast for from three to five minutes, this being
preceded by a small drink of water.</p>

<p>As the bowel condition improves, the time at the
breast may be gradually lengthened.</p>

<p>The mother should watch her diet to avoid too
much rich food, and foods that seem difficult to digest,
as certain articles of food in the mother’s diet often
causes gastric disturbances in the infant.</p>

<p>She should also carefully watch her thoughts, keeping
them well poised and upon kindness, love, and
peace. Worry or unkind thoughts will affect the
mother’s milk and disturb the child’s digestion very
quickly.</p>

<p>Fits of temper in the child also disturb its digestion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Times of
Feeding</div>

<p>Regular nursing habits should be insisted
on, as indigestion, colic, and diarrhea
often result from irregular nursing.</p>

<p>Some authorities discourage night feeding as unnecessary
with a normal baby, but most physicians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
agree that the child should be aroused during the day
in order not to miss a feeding, as it will fall asleep again
directly after nursing and will soon get into the habit
of awakening at feeding time.</p>

<p>The following table from Holt may be used as a

<p>There may be some slight deviations from this if
the child is ill and small for its age. It is a good general
rule to feed the child according to the age with
which its weight corresponds.</p>

<p>There can be no regular rule followed for all. Some
authorities hold that fifteen- to twenty-minute feedings
at four-hour intervals during the day, with one feeding
at night, are sufficient, but it depends on the child.
Some babies’ stomachs are smaller than others, and
some do not nurse regularly, but play and are inattentive
to the nursing. In either event the child will
not get sufficient nourishment at four-hour intervals.
The intelligent mother can determine what is best.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Water</div>

<p>In breast-feeding, as well as in most of
the formulæ for bottle-feeding, there is an
allowance for an amount of fluid that, under ordinary
circumstances, satisfies the baby’s requirements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
Additional water is often necessary, especially during
the hot weather when the body heat is regulated
through evaporation from the skin. The most effective
means of promoting perspiration is the giving of
water. This, however, should not be done to excess.
Eight ounces for a 10-pound baby, given in divided
doses during the day, will be sufficient.</p>

<p>It is best to give the water when the stomach is
nearly or quite empty. It should be boiled and cooled
and should be given by the bottle as the child will then
take at intervals all that its thirst requires, and the
danger of choking as a result of too hasty swallowing
is avoided.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Normal
Development
in the
Breast-Fed</div>

<p>The growth and general condition of the
child will, of course, be influenced by the
quality and quantity of the milk. The
birth weight of 7 to 7<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> pounds is usually
doubled by the end of the fifth month and
trebled by the end of the year. The average gain is
from 5 to 8 ounces a week during the first few months
and from 2 to 4 ounces a week the last few months of
the year.</p>

<p>If the mother’s milk is deficient in any way, the
child becomes fretful and loses weight, or the weight
remains stationary. In such cases the physician
usually examines the milk to determine its quality
and advises some means of improving it, or in some
way adding to the baby’s food the element in which
the mother’s milk is lacking.</p>

<p>The physical condition of the mother often affects
the baby’s nourishment, and besides resorting, temporarily,
to means for improving the quality of the milk,
she should build up her general vitality through regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
exercise for the spine and the vital organs, deep
breathing of fresh air, and regular rest.</p>

<p>While a scanty food supply will diminish the flow of
milk, overloading the stomach at meal time and taking
quantities of rich food between meals, as so many
nursing mothers, think is necessary, usually does little
to increase the quantity or improve the quality of the
milk, but often results in an accumulation of superfluous
flesh and disturbed digestion, which quickly
affects the child.</p>

<p>Sometimes a more restricted diet together with
specially directed exercises to relieve any digestive
disturbance and correct constipation, and relaxing
exercises for the nerves, will do more than anything
else to improve the quality of the milk.</p>

<p>Mothers should particularly avoid becoming overtired.</p>

<p>When the milk is good, but the quantity deficient,
massage of the breasts three or four times a day for
five or ten minutes will increase the supply. One
effective means of increasing the secretion of the mammary
glands is the mechanical stimulus of suction.
If a robust baby can be put to the breast for a time
it may develop an ample flow of milk for a puny infant
whose powers of suction are feeble.</p>

<p>A good malt extract with meals sometimes tends to
increase the flow of milk. When the quality and
quantity of the milk are deficient, the physician usually
advises a very nourishing diet and a tonic. This
nourishment does not of necessity require an excessive
amount of liquid.</p>

<p>When the quantity is sufficient, but the quality
poor, it is usually necessary to wean the baby, if it is
several months old, although mother’s milk, even if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
below standard in quality, is better for the infant than
cow’s milk, at least during the first few months.</p>

<p>Nervousness, sleeplessness, worry, and grief have a
decided effect on the milk supply and on the baby.
Nervous mothers are apt to have an abundance of milk
one day and little the next day; frequently the milk
will disappear suddenly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Weaning</div>

<p>When it is possible, the baby should be
weaned gradually. Although there is no
set time for weaning, it is not advisable to feed the
child exclusively from the breast after the eighth or
tenth month. Bunge holds that human milk contains
too little iron at this period and the babies are apt
to become pale and undernourished.</p>

<p>When additional feeding is decided on, the physician
should prescribe the preparation. A bottle a day
should be substituted for the breast feeding at first
and, gradually, additional bottle feedings, until,
after about a month the breast is entirely withdrawn.</p>

<p>After the eighth month and until the age of twelve
months, as a general rule, cow’s milk should be diluted
and sweetened by mixing eight ounces of barley water
and thirty-two ounces of milk, adding an ounce of
cane-sugar or milk-sugar, and dividing the whole into
five 8-ounce portions.</p>

<p>Additional food may be given to the healthy child
after the eighth or ninth month. Orange juice or
other fruit juice one or twice a day should be given
about an hour before feeding. A teaspoonful may
be given at first and the amount gradually increased
to about two tablespoonfuls a day.</p>

<p>Orange juice is a specific in conditions of scurvy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
resulting from improper feeding. The child usually
improves rapidly after it begins to take the juice.</p>

<p>Beef juice, meat broths, or strained vegetable soup
may be given in increasing amounts up to 5 or 6
ounces daily.</p>

<p>Zwieback and whole wheat or Graham crackers are
permissible in small amounts after the ninth month.
After nine months the healthy baby should also have
a soft-boiled egg occasionally, also baked apple and
well-cooked, mashed spinach or carrots.</p>

<p>Food should be given only at regular intervals and
nothing but water between feedings.</p>

<p>Starch-digesting ferments are present at birth in
sufficient amounts to digest the sugar in milk, but
they do not develop sufficiently to digest starches
until about the twelfth month, so white bread, crackers
made from white flour, potatoes, rice, etc., should not
be given the child under a year.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Artificial
Feeding</div>

<p>When artificial feeding is necessary,
the physician must decide what modification
is best for the baby. One can only determine
by experimenting upon the actual percentages
of fat, proteins, and sugar which each baby needs,
following, in general, the proportions contained in
mother’s milk, because while many babies thrive on a
food of this composition, some do not. The formulæ
given are simply a guide, as the proportions may need
to be changed, or may need to be made weaker in
some cases and stronger in others.</p>

<p>The composition of human milk, however, is a guide
to the infant’s digestive ability. This must be determined
by a careful study of the <em>individual baby</em> as
every baby is a problem by itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>As previously mentioned, no artificial food is the
same as human milk, although it may contain the same
proportions of the different elements, and it is often
difficult, especially during the first few months, to
prepare a combination on which the child will thrive.</p>

<p>Cow’s milk, properly prepared, is the nearest available
substitute for human milk. It must be modified,
as the digestion of the calf at birth is equal to that of
an infant at eight or nine months.</p>

<p>Farmers have in recent years become more particular
about the care of their cows and cleanliness in
milking because the educational campaign with regard
to the danger to human life from tuberculous animals
has caused a greater public demand for good, clean
milk.</p>

<p>Many infectious diseases are conveyed by milk, and
impure milk is a large cause of the extraordinarily
high mortality of early infancy. With the improvement
of the milk supply, the decline in the infant
death-rate has been wondrously gratifying.</p>

<p>Manufacturers have taken advantage of the fact
that the public has become a little afraid of cow’s
milk and have extensively advertised their prepared
foods, claiming them to be the best substitute for
mother’s milk. However, experiments have proven
that these statements for the most part are misleading,
the composition of the foods not being suited to the
actual requirements of the infant. Some prominent
physicians think that infant mortality has been increasing
since prepared foods have been used so
extensively.</p>

<p>One leading authority states that “clean, fresh cow’s
milk, properly modified, is the best substitute available.
It is to be preferred to any prepared food, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
matter how sweeping may be the manufacturers’
claim for it.”</p>

<p>The most striking thing about the prepared foods
is their tremendous excess of carbohydrates, either
cane-sugar or sugar derived from starch by the process
of malting. Condensed milk, in particular, contains
much too large a percentage of cane-sugar for the child.</p>

<p>Another authority states:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>An excess of sugar is likely to damage the organism by the production
of poisonous substances in the body. This is particularly
true in those infants who are already suffering from indigestion.
An excess of sugar in such a baby is likely to render him severely
and dangerously sick and result in catastrophe.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bacteriology</div>

<p>The study of the bacteriology of the
alimentary tract of the new-born infant
reveals a most interesting fact and explains why artificial
feeding is often so difficult and dangerous.</p>

<p>In the intestinal canal at all times many varieties
of vegetable organisms (bacteria) are present. These
are called floral organisms. Some of these aid digestion
while some others increase disturbance in the
intestines, particularly if in excess, or if digestive
derangements occur.</p>

<p>The flora which predominate are those peculiar to
the infant which is properly digesting human milk.
This accounts for the uniform action of the bowels
in breast-fed infants. As soon as the child gets
milk from the breast, the intestinal flora assume this
definite form.</p>

<p>When cow’s milk or any other food is given, the
intestinal flora change. When the change is made too
suddenly, these new flora which live on the digested
products of human milk gradually disappear and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
action of the new flora often causes intestinal derangements
which the infant is not strong enough to overcome.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Composition
of Human
Milk</div>

<p>If artificial feeding must be resorted to,
the composition should resemble mother’s
milk as nearly as possible. It is impossible
to duplicate it exactly and even though the
elements and the proportion of them are the same,
the bacterial flora will be different and consequently
the effect also.</p>

<p>If the breasts are emptied regularly, human milk
varies little in composition after the first few weeks.
According to Holt there is an average in mother’s
milk of</p>

<div class="sidenotel">Adaptation
of Cow’s
Milk</div>

<p>When the baby has been fed at the breast
for several months, pure cow’s milk sometimes
agrees very well, if overfeeding is
avoided.</p>

<p>The amount of milk taken every twenty-four hours
by a healthy infant is usually about 1<span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> ounces to the
pound of the baby’s weight.</p>

<p>A normal infant of twelve pounds would be taking
between twelve and eighteen ounces of milk in its
twenty-four hour mixture.</p>

<p>Budin recommends one-tenth of the body-weight
daily of milk and reports excellent results in infants
after the fifth or sixth month, weighing from thirteen
to fifteen pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span></p>

<p>Most infants under the age of nine months are more
or less incapable of digesting cow’s milk undiluted.
If artificial food is resorted to from the start, practically
all physicians agree that the milk should be
diluted or otherwise modified during the first few
months at least.</p>

<p>Milk diluted with water is often given, one part of
milk to two parts of water. This reduces the protein
to about the amount found in breast milk.</p>

<p>It is necessary to keep up the proportion of protein,
as this alone contains the important food element,
nitrogen. From one-half to three-fourths of an ounce
of milk-sugar is added to the twenty-four hours’
supply of food to approximate the seven per cent. found
in breast milk.</p>

<p>The proportion of milk and milk-sugar is gradually
increased and the water decreased, so that at the end
of the first or second month the baby gets equal parts
of milk and water and about an ounce more of milk-sugar.
This process is continued until, near the end
of the first year, the child is on whole milk. The
sugar is lessened as the water is omitted.</p>

<p>If, after a few months, it is desired to give a baby
starch in its food, cereal waters made of barley, rice,
wheat, or oatmeal may be used in place of plain water.</p>

<p>As cow’s milk leaves the stomach more slowly than
mother’s milk, longer intervals between feeding seem
advisable. When the breast-fed infant receives
nourishment every two and one-half to three hours,
an infant given a cow’s-milk preparation would be fed
every three and one-half or four hours.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to prevent both overfeeding
and underfeeding as these are often the greatest
factors in producing infantile disturbances. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
too rapid gain in weight, (from 8 to 12 ounces a week),
which often occurs in artificially fed infants, is not
a good sign.</p>

<p>Milk prepared according to the formula desired by
the physician can now be secured from milk laboratories
in all of our larger cities. However, the milk is
apt to spoil in transit, and to secure its freshness when
one is not in or near a large city, it is best to prepare
it at home. Any intelligent mother or nurse can do
this very satisfactorily if the physician gives definite
instructions.</p>

<p>Its careful preparation is quite as important as the
correct formula.</p>

<p>Mineral (calcium) and protein are bone and other
tissue builders, and it is a significant fact that cow’s
milk contains about twice as much protein and a little
more than twice as much of the mineral as mother’s
milk, indicating that the growth of the human infant
is to be slow. The calf requires about four years for
full growth and the human being twenty-one years.
Both human and cow’s milk, however, contain an
equal amount of fat, the heat-producing element, as
Nature intended that the infant should be warm and
active.</p>

<p>It seems almost impossible to get milk from the cow
as clean and free from bacteria as it should be and
therefore sterilization and pasteurization are resorted
to almost universally. Various substances such as
formaldehyd, boric acid, and salicylic acid are used
by dealers to preserve the milk. These all have a
deleterious effect on the child. Therefore the safety
of the child demands that the mother choose a reliable
dairy. The milk may be analyzed occasionally to
make sure of its purity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Top-Milk</div>

<p>A very popular milk preparation and one
frequently prescribed by physicians is the
top-milk method as originated by Dr. Holt.</p>

<p>Top-milk is that at the top of milk bottles in which
milk has been allowed to stand for five or six hours.</p>

<p>The cream at the top contains the most fat. For
instance, in a quart of milk that has been permitted
to stand, the</p>

of all infants and would therefore have to be modified
in some cases and made stronger in others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></p>

<p>The one thing to be particularly guarded against is
overloading the stomach with rich food. On account
of the high percentage of fat, digestive disturbances
often occur when top-milk is used. Some infants can
dispose of an abundance of fat from the beginning and
most of them can after six or nine months, but many
infants have difficulty in digesting fat. The condition
called “fat rickets” may exist, though the child may
seem to thrive and increase in weight. Its flesh, however,
is not hard and firm as it should be in health.</p>

<p>The cream from Guernsey and Jersey cows is
usually too rich for infants and therefore the best milk
for the baby is that from Holstein or grade cows.
The mixed milk from various cows is usually best.</p>

<p>The physician can determine from the stools if the
fat ratio is too high, in which case it is best to use top-milk
lower in percentage of fat, and lengthen the feeding
intervals to four hours.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Certified
Milk</div>

<p>If the additional expense of certified milk
can be met, it is advisable to use it in preparing
the baby’s food, as it is reasonably
constant in its composition and is prepared under the
most hygienic conditions, in accordance with the
requirements of the American Association of Medical
Milk Commissions.</p>

<p>All utensils used in preparing the baby’s milk must
be absolutely clean. Bacteria develop very quickly
in milk and, therefore, the bottles, nipples, etc., should
be kept as germ-free as possible by being boiled daily,
and the nipples, when not in use, should be kept in a
solution of boracic acid (one-fourth ounce boracic acid
to one-half pint of water).</p>

<p>The artificially fed baby does not usually thrive as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
well as the breast-fed infant. It does not gain in
weight as fast and the teeth are slower in coming.
The general condition of the baby, and a steady, even
if slow gain in weight, will indicate whether the food
is agreeing.</p>

<p>Every baby, however, is a law unto itself and it
sometimes requires considerable study to determine
what is the best food. Even with the utmost care a
cow’s-milk preparation cannot be made identical with
mother’s milk and sometimes an entirely different
mixture must be resorted to.</p>

<p>However, no mother should attempt to experiment
on her baby or permit herself to be misled by the advertisements
of so-called Baby Foods. It is only
when these are used in the right proportion and in
combination with other ingredients that they can be
suited to the requirements of the infant.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Milk
Modifications</div>

<p>Malt used in place of milk-sugar or cane-sugar
will greatly assist the absorption of
fat and decrease the tendency to fermentation
and colic. It is being extensively used
in milk modifications.</p>

<p>It is best to use the dextrin-maltose preparations
that do not contain sodium chlorid, as it is rarely
advisable to add this salt to the infant’s food.</p>

<p>Some physicians have been securing very satisfactory
results with a preparation containing whey.
Whey is a thin, watery fluid, looking very much like
skimmed milk; its caloric value is about 300 per quart,
9 per ounce, barely one-half that of whole milk. It
is therefore adapted only to temporary feeding, while
its low fat content is of great value in cases of fat
dyspepsia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>To secure the whey, 5 grams (1 teaspoonful) of
rennet should be used to each quart of milk. The
mixture must be kept at a temperature of about 100 F.
until it separates into a liquid and a solid portion. It
is then strained through cheesecloth. Practically
all the casein is left on the cloth, the fluid being the
whey. The curd should be broken up before straining,
in order to obtain, as nearly as possible, the casein.
However, about two-thirds of the milk fats remain in
the curd. The whey, besides the whey proteins, thus
contains only about one-third of the fats, but nearly
all of the milk-sugar and salts. The whey still contains
the rennet and, to destroy this, the whey must be
heated to at least 140 F. for thirty minutes.</p>

<p>The average composition of whey according to
Wachenheim is as follows:</p>

<p>Sometimes sugar is the primary cause of intestinal
fermentation, due to the concentration of the whey
and the relative proportions of casein and sugar in the
mixture.</p>

<p>According to Finkelstein and Meyer, to prepare a
food which will combat intestinal fermentation there
must be:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>A diminution in the quantity of milk-sugar, a diminution of
the salts through dilution of the whey, and an increase in the
casein, with varying, and, under certain circumstances, not inconsiderable
amounts of fat. After improvement has begun, an
easily assimilable and consequently little fermentable carbohydrate
should be added.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span></p>

<p>They developed a food to meet these requirements
to which they gave the name of “<em>Eiweissmilch</em>.”
This food is prepared as follows:</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Heat one quart of whole milk to 100 F.; add four teaspoonfuls
of essence of pepsin, and stir. Let the
mixture stand at 100 F. until the curd has formed, then
strain. Press the mass of curd through a rather fine
sieve two or three times by the means of a wooden
mallet or spoon. Add one pint of water to the curd
during this process. The mixture should now look
like milk and the precipitate must be very finely
divided. Add one pint of buttermilk to this mixture.</p>

<p>Finkelstein and Meyer used buttermilk in the preparation
of this food:</p>

<p>(1) Because of the small amount of milk-sugar
which it contains;</p>

<p>(2) To obtain the good effects of the lactic acid;</p>

<p>(3) Because buttermilk can be kept for a longer
time.</p>

<p>The composition of this food is:</p>

<p>One quart of this milk contains about 360 calories.</p>

<p>They call attention to the low caloric value of this
food and to the necessity of increasing it as soon as
possible by the addition of dextrin-maltose mixtures.</p>

<p>They claim that it is worthy of employment in all
the disturbances of nutrition in infants, which are
accompanied by diarrhea, of no matter what kind.
The use of this food has been extended by others to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
sorts of conditions including the feeding of healthy
infants and the newly born, and good results are
claimed for it.</p>

<p>To use a food low in sugar and salts and high in
protein in the fermentative conditions caused by
sugar, is rational. In these conditions the substitution
of the dextrin-maltose mixtures for lactose is
also good.</p>

<p>Not all disturbances of nutrition accompanied by
diarrhea, however, are due to the same cause and
should not be treated in the same way. No method
of feeding can be applicable to both the sick and the
well, nor can all babies be given the same food without
regard to their individual digestive ability.</p>

<p>The main principles of this method of treating intestinal
fermentative conditions may be used and, at the
same time, the disadvantages of a routine food may
be avoided, by applying the modification of milk
by the percentage method as given by Moise and
Talbot.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Sterilizing
and
Pasteurizing</div>

<p>To sterilize the milk it should be heated
to 212 F., that temperature being maintained
for ten minutes or longer.</p>

<p>Many physicians consider pasteurization
the better process. In this the milk is heated to from
150 to 165 F. and kept at that temperature for from
twenty to thirty minutes. Boiling produces chemical
changes, such as converting the milk-sugar into caramel,
etc., while pasteurizing does not.</p>

<p>After pasteurization or sterilization, the milk should
be quickly cooled to a temperature of 40 F. or lower
and kept, until used, in bottles corked with non-absorbent
cotton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span></p>

<p>Sterilized or pasteurized milk does not keep as
well as raw milk probably on account of the change
in the ferments which destroy bacteria; therefore
the baby’s milk should be pasteurized fresh every
day.</p>

<p>Freeman’s pasteurizer is a very satisfactory and
simple device. It consists of a metal pail into which
is fitted a rack with a separate cylinder for each bottle.
This holds just enough cold water to surround the
bottle and keep it from cracking through a sudden
change of temperature. The pail, containing a certain
amount of water, is placed on the stove, the water
is heated to the boiling point, the pail being then removed.
The rack of bottles containing the milk preparation,
with corks of non-absorbent cotton, is placed
in it and the lid applied. The apparatus is placed
away from a direct current of air for about forty-five
minutes.</p>

<p>As the water in the pail cools, the milk in the bottles
grows warm until both are at the same temperature.
After forty-five minutes, cold water is turned
into the pail to cool the bottles rapidly. They
are then kept on ice until again warmed ready for
use.</p>

<p>This is the simplest and best way to pasteurize milk
and the expense is small.</p>

<p>Improvised apparatus may be used, but it requires
much more labor and is not as satisfactory.</p>

<p>All milk should be sterilized or pasteurized before
being used as a food for infants.</p>

infant foods helpful in the selection of a food to supply

2 per cent. protein, 0.6 per cent. fat, 5.1 per cent.
carbohydrates, giving a food value of ten calories per
ounce, just one-half the value of milk. In certain
forms of intestinal trouble in which cow’s milk is not
assimilated, this gruel is valuable used with condensed
milk.</p>

<p>Malted gruels are made by adding 1 teaspoonful of
good malt extract or diastase to a cereal gruel after
it has been cooled. It should be stirred in very
thoroughly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Vomiting</div>

<p>In artificial feeding “spitting” is usually
an annoying symptom that does not indicate
anything more serious than an overloaded
stomach. This condition is usually relieved by
lengthening the feeding intervals to four hours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, vomiting usually indicates something
more serious in a bottle-fed baby, especially if it
is very persistent. It is usually a sign that cow’s
milk, or the preparation of it, is not agreeing with the
infant. It also indicates a digestive disturbance that
should be treated only by the physician, who will
probably change the formula.</p>

<p>Occasional vomiting is sometimes due to too rich
food and too frequent feeding. Lengthening the
feeding hours and decreasing the amount of fat in
the mixture will usually eliminate the trouble.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Colic</div>

<p>This is the most common of all of baby’s
troubles. It is often due to too rapid feeding
either from the breast or bottle, and when there is
a tendency to colic, the feeding should be slower. The
baby should not be fed while it is suffering from colic,
even though it seems that the drinking of warm milk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
relieves it temporarily. Hot water should be given
every half-hour or hour until relieved. If the baby
seems cold, hot water slightly sweetened, and a hot
bath, should be given at once. A hot-water bottle
may be placed near it as well.</p>

<p>In colic there is severe pain in the abdomen, which
is swollen and hard. Sudden and violent crying is
usually a symptom of colic, which often ceases very
suddenly after the emission of gas from the mouth or
bowels.</p>

<p>If the baby seems exhausted, the physician should
be summoned at once, but these suggestions may
be helpful until the physician arrives.</p>

<p>When colic is very frequent in a bottle-fed baby,
the food should be modified.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Stools
in Infancy</div>

<p>The character of the stools depends
primarily on the composition of the food.
They are varied according to the digestive
powers of the infant, and according to the amount and
rapidity of absorption of the products of digestion.
The amount of absorption depends to a considerable
extent on the rapidity with which the contents pass
through the intestinal tract.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The nature of the food, of course, influences the
character of the stools. The examination of the stools
is of the greatest aid in determining whether or not
any given food element is properly digested and assimilated,
and, in many diseased conditions, in telling
what element is at fault. This, however, can only be
determined by analysis, but a little information on this
subject will be of value to the mother or nurse.</p>

<p>During the first few weeks or months of life, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
breast-fed infant has three or four stools daily.
These are of about the consistency of thick pea soup
and are golden yellow. The number of stools gradually
diminishes to two or three in the twenty-four
hours, and the consistency becomes more salve-like.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for thriving breast-fed babies
to have a large number of stools of diminished consistency
and of a brownish color; in such instances,
the examination of the breast milk will show that the
proteins are high.</p>

<p>It is best not to pay too much attention to the
stools if the baby is gaining in weight and appears well.
It is not unusual to find many soft fine curds and
sometimes mucus in the stools of healthy breast-fed
babies.</p>

<p>It is not only unnecessary, but decidedly wrong to
wean a baby simply because the stools are abnormal,
if it is doing well in other ways. The breast-fed infant
will often go weeks or months without a normal stool
and yet thrive perfectly. On the other hand, if a
baby has such stools when it is taking cow’s milk it is
a decided evidence of malnutrition.</p>

<p>Infants that are thriving on cow’s milk have, as a
general rule, fewer movements in the twenty-four
hours than do breast-fed babies and these movements
are firmer in consistency.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Constipation</div>

<p>Constipation seems to be the chief difficulty
in artificial feeding, due usually to
the poor absorption of fat, or the low percentage necessary
to prevent indigestion. If the constipation is
not severe, the substitution of oatmeal for barley
water in the mixture will usually relieve the trouble.</p>

<p>If the constipation is severe, causing occasional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
attacks of colic or straining at stool, it is sometimes
advisable to give a little higher percentage of fat in
the mixture, but this should be done very cautiously
and usually on the advice of the physician.</p>

<p>If, however, this does not relieve the trouble, the
best plan is to substitute one of the dextrin-maltose
mixtures for milk-sugar or cane-sugar. The malt
itself is not especially laxative but it prevents the
excessive fermentation which usually occurs when the
bowels are very costive.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Diarrhea</div>

<p>Two, three, or more green and loose
evacuations, even though they may contain
whitish particles of undigested fat, are of no great
significance in the breast-fed infant, but should be
regarded as danger signals in bottle-fed babies.</p>

<p>Even a mild attack of diarrhea is usually a symptom
of fat-dyspepsia which, if taken in time, may usually
be promptly checked.</p>

<p>A dose of castor-oil at the beginning of the attack
may relieve any irritation that might have caused the
trouble.</p>

<p>It is best to omit all food for at least twenty-four
hours. Plain water should be given very freely and
occasionally barley water, if the baby is hungry.
After that it is best to start with a mixture low in
fat. Skimmed milk or boiled milk free from all fat,
diluted with cereal water, may be given at regular
intervals.</p>

<p>Should slight diarrheal attacks continue, or should
the stools be of a diarrheal character, the wisest plan
is to substitute a dextrin-maltose mixture for the sugar,
as malt decidedly favors fat absorption.</p>

<p>In almost every case of infantile diarrhea it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
advisable to consult the physician, especially if there
is considerable restlessness and rise in temperature.</p>

<p>Diarrhea is more frequent in summer among bottle-fed
babies, as the heat often promotes the growth of
germs in the milk. Therefore to sterilize or pasteurize
milk during the heated months is especially
necessary.</p>

<p>A chill, due to insufficient clothing, will sometimes
cause diarrhea. The abdomen, arms, and legs should
be kept warm by close-fitting garments of soft wool.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Anemia</div>

<p>In treating anemia in infants, as in
adults, the cause should be removed by
correcting any errors in diet and treating any other
physical deficiencies.</p>

<p>The cause of infantile anemia is an insufficient
absorption of iron from the food.</p>

<p>The amount of iron in both human milk and cow’s
milk is small and is insufficient for the needs of the
growing infant. However, Nature has deposited
enough iron in the liver of the new-born infant to
last until it can digest foods which contain iron in
sufficient amounts. The iron in human milk is
apparently more easily retained than that in the milk
of animals.</p>

<p>The iron content of human milk is dependent on the
general condition of the mother. It is higher in
healthy individuals and lower in those under par.</p>

<p>Anemia in infants is apt to become severe and often
take on a pernicious form. A prolonged intestinal
disturbance often brings on anemia, and not infrequently
anemia is due to a deficiency of protein in the
food.</p>

<p>The treatment consists largely of additions or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
changes in the diet, depending on the age of the infant.
Purées of vegetables that contain much iron, such as
spinach and carrots, and also fruit juices, are valuable
and in proper proportions can be added to the diet after
the age of six months. It is best that the physician
decide on the advisability of this as it will depend on
the general condition of the infant.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Rickets</div>

<p>Rickets, a chronic impairment of nutrition,
affects not only the bones, but all of
the tissues of the body, particularly the nervous
system. Artificial feeding is the chief cause of rickets
on account of the poor absorption of fats, and often
because of protein starvation.</p>

<p>Prepared foods, on account of their large percentage
of starch and their lack of protein and butter-fat are
frequently the cause of rickets.</p>

<p>In addition to its fuel value, milk-fat contains the
elements which promote growth.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the infant requires a certain
percentage of protein, fat, and mineral for the blood
and tissue building and the growth of the bones. In
artificial feeding, the preparations given are often
deficient in these important elements.</p>

<p>Climate and poor hygienic surroundings sometimes
cause rickets in breast-fed babies, probably on account
of the lowered vitality of the mother and the child
and consequently poor digestion and assimilation, but
it is most frequently found in babies improperly
fed.</p>

<p>Dr. Winfield S. Hall says:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Fresh milk, appropriately modified and in proper amount,
together with such other food as is indicated for the age and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
weight, is the important point in the treatment of rickets. Fresh
air, day and night, sunshine and outdoor life, are only next in
happiness. Cod-liver oil, especially with the addition of phosphorus,
is a very valuable addition to the treatment.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Scurvy</div>

<p>Rickets is a chronic condition, while
scurvy is an acute disease.</p>

<p>This difficulty is considered as entirely due to improper
feeding and therefore must be overcome by a
change of diet. Recovery is usually very rapid when
the child is properly fed.</p>

<p>Pains and tenderness about the joints, particularly
of the legs, are the usual symptoms, causing the
baby to cry when it is lifted or moved about. The
gums sometimes become swollen and bleed. In
almost every case it is found that infants suffering
from scurvy have been on a continuous diet of prepared
foods like malted milk, condensed milk, or
boiled milk which Dr. Hall terms “dead food,”
presumably on account of a lack of the life-giving
proteins and butter-fat.</p>

<p>When boiled milk has been used, the change should
be made to pasteurized milk or raw milk if it can be
secured clean and fresh. If prepared foods have been
given, the amount should be greatly decreased and
replaced by a cow’s-milk preparation in which a
small percentage of the prepared food may be included,
or, better still, omitted entirely, if a cow’s-milk
preparation including a good substantial gruel will
agree.</p>

<p>In scurvy, orange juice or other fruit juices should
be given, from 1 to 4 ounces a day, according to the
age. Orange juice is particularly valuable, 2 or 3
teaspoonfuls being given before each feeding.</p>

<p>A lack of fresh air often aids in producing scurvy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Feeding
during the
Second
Year</div>

<p>After the baby has reached the age of
one year, we often feel that it is not necessary
to be so careful of its diet. However,
the number of deaths due to digestive
disturbances caused by improper feeding
during the second year is significant.</p>

<p>After the child is a year old it should be given solid
food <em>very gradually</em> to develop its digestive functions
as well as its teeth. A soft-boiled egg or a little beef
juice may be added to the diet. Until the appearance
of the anterior molar teeth, however, the child’s diet
should be confined largely to milk. A thin slice of
buttered bread or a little plain rice or rice pudding, a
soda cracker or bread crumbs in milk may be given.
The year-old child may also begin to drink cow’s milk.
One or two glasses a day may be given, until the child
is at least 13 or 14 years old.</p>

<p>Good judgment should be used in feeding children,
as habits and tastes are being formed, and whether
they are normal or abnormal will depend on the kind
of food given and when.</p>

<p>Four meals a day, at regular intervals, and nothing
but water between these intervals, is considered the
best plan.</p>

<p>Dry toast, zwieback, and crackers may be gradually
added to the diet, also well-cooked cereals, like cream
of wheat, rice, and oatmeal. The oatmeal should be
strained the first few months it is given. Very little
sugar should be added to the cereals, as children very
quickly cultivate a desire for sweets, rejecting other
more nourishing foods, and too much sugar is apt to
disturb the digestion. It is best during the first few
months that no sugar be added to cereals.</p>

<p>The amount of whole milk, or milk diluted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
barley or oatmeal gruel, should be limited to one
quart when the other foods are given.</p>

<p>Beef juice (from one to two ounces), mutton broth,
chicken broth, and cereal broths may be given after
the age of one year; not more than two ounces at first,
gradually increasing in a few months’ time to four
ounces. This is best given at the beginning of the
noon feeding. These broths have little nutritive
value, but usually stimulate the appetite for other
foods.</p>

<p>The child must build muscle, bone, and sinew, and
more protein is required as soon as he begins to walk.
Milk, eggs, and cereals will furnish this. The heavier
protein diet is best given at eighteen months to two
years, in eggs, cooked soft. An egg may be given
every other day, soft boiled for about two minutes, or
coddled for four minutes. At the age of two years
an egg may be given every day. These soft-cooked
eggs are best when mixed with broken dry toast or
broken whole wheat or Graham crackers, because if
dry food is served with them they will be better
masticated, hence more saliva be mixed with them.</p>

<p>The habit of thorough mastication should be
cultivated at this period.</p>

<p>Oatmeal, thoroughly cooked, and shredded wheat,
with cream and sugar, ripe fruit, bread and butter,
milk, soft-cooked eggs (poached or boiled), constitute
a rational diet at this age.</p>

<p>Bread is better broken in milk because the chewing
movements mix the saliva with the milk and smaller
curds are formed as the milk enters the stomach.</p>

<p>Custard may after two years be added to the diet,
also baked or mashed potato, plain boiled macaroni,
also a little butter on the potato, toast, or bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span></p>

<p>Also after the age of eighteen months, a small
quantity of very lean meat, like scraped or chopped
beef or lamb, or finely minced chicken, may be given
once a day.</p>

<p>Also well-cooked and mashed vegetables like peas,
spinach, carrots, and asparagus tips. For the first
few months these should be strained.</p>

<p>Some fruit should also be given each day, orange
juice, apple sauce, or the pulp of stewed prunes; the
latter especially is valuable when the bowels are
inclined to be constipated.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee, and cocoa are absolutely objectionable,
and before the age of two years no kind of candy
should be given.</p>

<p>One of the most important things to teach the child,
when it is taking foods other than milk, is thorough
mastication, not only to assist the proper growth of the
teeth, but to prevent the digestive disturbances that
invariably occur from the bolting of food, and children
are especially liable to do this.</p>

<p>Dry toast and zwieback compel mastication and
strengthen the gums. These should be given in the
hand, a piece at mealtime and occasionally between
meals, if the child seems hungry. The child will then
gradually get into the habit of chewing other solid
foods when they are given.</p>

<p>If the child is hungry between meals, he should be
fed at a regular period, midway between breakfast
and luncheon and between luncheon and the evening
meal. The food should be dry (toast or a dry cracker)
to induce thorough and slow mastication.</p>

<p>Many object to “piecing” between meals, but if this
piecing be done at hours as regular as his meal hour,
and the food be dry and well masticated, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
readily digest and will not interfere with his meals.
The growing child needs more frequent meals than
the adult. His stomach is not so large, he is active
in outdoor exercise, and eliminates waste freely. He
also requires much heat and energy. The active child
at outdoor play uses almost as much energy as the
laboring man.</p>

<p>Many mothers are in doubt as to whether the
baby’s food should be salted. It is necessary to add a
very little salt to the food for the baby; broths should
be seasoned slightly and a pinch of salt added to
potatoes and eggs. Cereals and vegetables are cooked
in water to which a little salt has been added.</p>

<p>Experienced observers of children and their ailments
and diseases have said that more babies are killed
by overfeeding than by underfeeding. Especially in
summer, when the child’s condition reflects that of the
mother, too much food will cause indigestion, irritation
of the stomach, and diarrhea.</p>

<p>Often the child is fretful because it is too warm or is
thirsty. It will often be benefited by giving it less
food and more water. This fretful mind affects the
child’s digestion just as it affects the digestion of the
mother.</p>

<p>If a healthy child refuses good, wholesome food
because it wishes some other than what is offered it,
it is not hungry and doesn’t need the food.</p>

<p>The growing child craves sweets, but a child should
not be given candy whenever it wants it during the
day. Candy or sugar is quickly converted into heat
and is best eaten immediately following a meal.
Sugar may be spread on bread for the four o’clock
lunch or a little candy may be eaten at this time. Two
or three pieces of candy an inch square are sufficient.</p>

<h3>MEASURES AND WEIGHTS</h3>

<p>A few tables of measures may be helpful here because
accurate measurements are necessary to
insure success in the preparation of any article of food.</p>

<p>All dry ingredients, such as flour, meal, powdered
sugar, etc., should be sifted before measuring.</p>

<p>The standard measuring cup contains one-half pint
and is divided into fourths and thirds.</p>

<p>To measure a cupful or spoonful of dry ingredients,
fill the cup or spoon and then level off with the back
of a case-knife.</p>

<p>In measures of weight the gram is the unit.</p>

<p>A “heaping cupful” is a level cup with two tablespoonfuls
added.</p>

<p>A “scant cupful” is a level cup with two tablespoonfuls
taken out.</p>

<p>A “saltspoon” is one-fourth of a level teaspoon.</p>

<p>To measure butter, lard, and other solid foods, pack
solidly in spoon or cup and level with a knife.</p>
